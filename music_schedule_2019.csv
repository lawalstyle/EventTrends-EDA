10,Adam Ostrar,"Before the 2016 election, an album like this might be called a “dystopia”; now we call it “did you see what he tweeted?” On Ostrar’s new album, he weaves together disparate voices, like a non-fiction version of Our Town. ""The Worried Coat"" out April 5th on Super Secret Records, was recorded in part in Mexico City courtesy of Richard Davies (The Moles) hand-me-down studio time and the other half at a ranch in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona, Ostrar wrapped and warped his Gretsch Country Gentleman guitar around these groovy nuggets of capitalistic despair, cretinism, gas lighting, nationalism and nativism, false heroism, and that good-time tug-of-war (this game is rigged) called Inherited Wealth vs. Inherited Debt. But he wasn’t alone in making this album, so don’t worry too much about him. He brought along Michael Krassner (Boxhead Ensemble), Wil Hendricks (Califone), and Stephen Patterson (Hamilton Leithauser). 
This is Ostrar’s second solo album, the follow-up to 2017’s Brawls In the Briar. Before that, he led the early 2000 shag-carpet art-punk of Manishevitz, an early Jagjaguwar band that toured with The Mountain Goats and Edith Frost before the Internet tracked these things.

After several successful years singing Top 40 covers and standards across the country, Adrian decided to focus on his own music and developed Caged Bird. Adrian has performed his music as a five piece band as part of a two month residency series at the inaugural US multimedia exhibition The Velvet Underground Experience, which opened in New York City on Oct. 10.

As a native of the Southside (Roseland area) of Chicago, Aina Brei’Yon personifies strength. Since her conception, she has made it very clear that boundaries do not apply to her. Early on in her career, she understood the importance of being true to who she is and embracing idealism. Her reality is defined by her beliefs; a message that transcends through her music. As the second to youngest of 10 children, self-expression and showing any type of emotion was simply non-existent in their family. She says, “I found an outlet with music at the young age of nine. Writing was the only way I knew how to express myself.”
As a creator of experiences, Aina’s talent of using her music to tell her stories has presented her with several opportunities to open up for acts such as J.Holiday, Talib Kweli, Soulja Boy, Keith Murray, Crucial Conflict, Sammie, and B2K. Her audience consists of multigenerational like-minded male and female individuals who find themselves embracing the energy of Aina Brei’Yon.

He put in work and paid his dues from jump, knowing that solidifying his natural talent and achieving success would take dedication and plenty of perseverance. 
His work ethic and lyrical skills eventually started to reach new ears in the LA rap scene, including those of Compton star Problem and his Diamond Lane Music Group family. He was relentless in pursuit of his goal – joining Diamond Lane – submitting several projects to the label of the span of more than a year. 
It was that same persistence, when paired with his knack for clever wordplay and his meshing of his rapping and singing talents, which ultimately earned him the time and respect of Diamond Lane’s CEO. 
He was featured on Problem’s 2017 project “Chachiville” and listeners instantly gravitated to the newcomer, including XXL Magazine and many others. His smooth cadences and creative style finally helped him achieve a major goal: signing with Diamond Lane.

27,Alex Di Leo,"Every song from Alex Di Leo is an automatic escape from day-to-day life, a retreat into a state of mind that’s more hopeful and carefree and full of possibility. With his soulful vocals and crystalline melodies, the Fort Lauderdale-based singer/songwriter delivers an impassioned breed of indie-pop that melts away everyday worries and leaves the listener inspired to live more fearlessly.
Given their transportive power, it’s fitting that so many of Di Leo’s songs are sparked by his adventures in visiting new cities all over the country and across the globe. “I’m always most motivated to write when I’m in a place I’ve never been before,” says the 22-year-old artist. “Even just riding on the plane when I’m traveling somewhere new seems to do something to me, and the melodies just start to come together.”
On his new EP Strange Open Land, Di Leo channels that inspiration into an intricately detailed but hook-heavy sound. The follow-up to his debut EP So We Go—a 2016 release that landed Di Leo on the top 20 at more than 100 college radio stations around the U.S.—the EP also perfectly captures the infectious energy that Di Leo’s shown in sharing stages with such artists as Barns Courtney

As a principle character on A&E’s reality show, Crazy Hearts, the world got its first glimpse into the life of the burgeoning country music starlet. But just as Amy’s music was beginning to connect, life got in the way. Her engagement was called off, her future plans dissolved, and the turmoil brewing in Amy’s personal life crept into her craft. “I learned the hard way that not everything is meant to be. Sometimes timing is everything. After the dust settled, I struggled to reconnect creatively. I was in a very different place, and honestly it was really tough,” Amy recalls. Her relationship went south, but instead of dwelling on what might have been, Amy picked herself up and headed West, on a new journey of personal and artistic growth. L

These include being an advice columnist for the Village Voice and Vice Magazine, the host of a Cartoon Network children's game show, and giving motivational lectures on positive partying at Yale, NYU, Carnegie Mellon, and the U.K.'s Oxford University. As the prodigious piano playing party prophet nears his second decade of dynamic performance, his hard partying spirit shows no signs of slowing... or softening.

55,Andy Jenkins,"Hatched in the tradition of Southern culture—unhurried in his art, yet weirdly ahead of the curve by the time he arrives— Andy Jenkins is a joyously idiosyncratic songwriting talent, ripened over years of relative obscurity. 'Sweet Bunch' springs into the world fully-formed, sitting at the crossroads of modernism and timelessness, sensitivity and decision, with the expansiveness and musical drawl of Big Star, the bounce of John Prine, and the curly, perfectly-carved melodies of George Harrison. Each song paints a wild landscape, the mood of a sun setting on a damn good day among friends and favored creatures.
 
Andy is a kind of unheard counterpoint, originating from the same small scene of independent Virginia youth culture that produced artists like Justin Frye (PC Worship) Natalie Prass, and Matthew E. White, all friends from his teenage years. Produced by longtime collaborator White, with the Spacebomb crew and another old friend, Phil Cook, running hard into midnight, 'Sweet Bunch' was essentially recorded in three days of flow-state, with the drums, bass, keys, and guitars all live and nothing to regret. Backed by some ringers and a very full chorus, Andy’s warm words come bu

56,...And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead,"An unlikely but powerful combination of punk fury and prog rock ambition, ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead were formed in late 1994 by singers/guitarists/drummers Jason Reece and Conrad Keely. The longtime friends originally met in Hawaii before settling in the indie hotbed of Olympia, Washington, where Reece drummed for the notorious Mukilteo Fairies. After relocating together to Austin, Texas, the duo began playing shows as ""You Will Know Us by theTrail of Dead,"" eventually adding both the conjunction and the ellipsis to the band's name. The pair also recruited guitarist Kevin Allen and bassist/sampler Neil Busch, thus transforming the group from an indie two-piece into an arty quartet. After issuing a live cassette on the local Golden Hour label, AYWKUBTTOD -- already legendary in indie circles for their anarchic concert sets -- released their self-titled full-length debut on Trance Syndicate in early 1998. Following the label's collapse, the band moved to Merge's roster and issued Madonna in the fall of 1999.

58,Anemone,"Anemone is a real live band - created and lead by songwriter and musician Chloé Soldevila, accompanied by Miles Dupire-Gagnon, Gabriel Lambert, Zachary Irving and Samuel Gemme. Calling it « limitless pop », it is music to be blasted from car speakers and at parties, a communal experience intended to be shared, the kind of emotional catharsis that can pack a dance floor—sometimes even packing the stage as well. Creatively incorporating aspects that can vary from dream pop, dance music and krautrock, it is music that will stick with you, that will live inside your brain, that will become a part of you forever. It is music that refuses to be ignored.

Angelica Garcia lends her astonishing voice to her poetically woven musings and statements of intent. In a time when music should stand up and isn’t, she’s an old head on young shoulders and a total anomaly.
After an unhappy period with a major label, 24-year-old Garcia has had a fantastic grounding in what not to do and has spent the past 2 years plotting her own sound and vision. The first fruits of her labour, the single ‘Karma The Knife” drifted out recently winning over people drawn to her beat-driven, sharp and persistently melodic pop music.  She’s extremely hard to compare, but there’s certainly elements of Beck, The Beastie Boys, Jack White and Kimbra all through Garcia’s particular kaleidoscopic worldview. 
An album is close to completion and is expected in early 2019.

Angie’s worked on records that feel like the days hip hop started, songs that take you to a beach in her family's home town of Manati Puerto Rico, and tracks that could rival your favorite Dj’s playlist. When it comes to artistry she has it all! But her movement doesn’t stop there, she is also the founder of a brand called Unstoppable Threadz, which funds initiatives that bring hope to communities, towns and “barrios” all over the world. Her message has flooded the streets of the Bronx, walked the streets of Houston, and kissed the ground of orphanages in the heart of Mexico. Her message is grounded in faith but far from religious. Her goal is to use both words and action to spur a generation to do the unthinkable. Change their mind and in essence change their world. We are Unstoppable!!

'Fear Naught' also featured on Spotify's New Music Friday editorial playlist.

While they incorporate a wealth of stylistic touchstones, their uniqueness presents as a thoughtful amalgam of indie pop carried by crispy, subdued electronic percussion. The eponymous Michael Doherty nimbly lavishes and bolsters each song with an angelic, agile vocal style, occasionally harking back to early 2000s R&B. But the group’s crafty instrumentation and production sit center stage too, consistently driven by a diverse sound palette that flashes with a distinct compositional elegance.
Having just changed their homebase from Albany to Philadelphia, the freshly transplanted group is looking to make a new home for themselves. And it shouldn't be hard to fit in, with the group's influences ranging from (Sandy) Alex G to Ariana Grande to PC Music, a wide spectrum that lends itself to Another Michael's unique musical presence.

67,Another Sky,"When you listen to Another Sky, it’s probably Catrin Vincent’s voice that’ll catch your attention first. It is a weapon – peculiar, androgynous, lurching and defiant – that she wields to beautiful, evocative effect. When Guardian music critic Caroline Sullivan saw the band perform at The Great Escape this year, she tweeted, “I'm almost dumbstruck by the singer – she has the strangest, most haunting voice I've heard in ages.” Catrin is delighted that people find it so strange. “A lot of people think I’m a man,” she laughs. “I think people are embarrassed when they initially think it’s one of the guys singing, but I love it. It’s like I’ve got two voices – there’s this soft, whispery voice that can go really high, and then suddenly there’s this angry chest voice. Somewhere along the way, I drew two voices together.” 
Catrin’s unusual vocals certainly caught the attention of her future band mates – drummer Max, bassist Naomi and guitarist Jack ¬– when they were studying music together at Goldsmiths University. Before they came together to form Another Sky (which is named after an Emily Dickinson poem), “we were all just drifting,” says Catrin.

The band came together when singer and main lyricist Laura Hayden moved to London from Barcelona and started writing songs with Josh. “I always wanted to do music but I never had the balls or the knowledge,” she explains. “And when I wanted to start writing, Josh had, er, ""good credentials"".” Those credentials included being in a band with an ex of Laura’s but the chemistry was good and the two soon built up a body of songs, before recruiting Harry and, later, Jackson to the cause. In desperate need of a name to put their songs to online, they picked Anteros - the god of requited love, a landmark in London that united the scattered members in one place and, most importantly, the title of the song that cemented their retro-tinged indie pop sound.

But that’s exactly where Apre’s story begins.  

Charlie Brown and Jules Konieczny were no strangers to making music individually, but it wasn’t until Sue who runs Ealing chess club (or, to use her full title “this legend called Sue”) suggested they should hook up and work together that the strands that make up Apre’s unique sound started to fuse together.

“She knew that we shared this passion for music and she paired us up,” recalls Brown, “we started playing together and found this love for the same thing.”

However, things didn’t quite immediately leap forwards from that moment to where we are today. Three years passed and Brown and Konieczn would spend their days playing in other groups, producing, working on other people’s material, making ends meet and trying to find their way in music.

74,Ari Chi,"Ari Chi is a singer, songwriter, instrumentalist & producer born in Atlanta and raised in Tampa, FL. Ari has been cultivating her passion for music since her formal training in high school, and took that to new heights when she decided to pick up the ukulele after a short stint with a guitar--unlike the guitar, she could take the ukulele everywhere. 
Ari began uploading acoustic covers to YouTube in 2013, and developed her skill by practicing daily. That work paid off when Ari’s cover of “Timmy Turner” went viral and landed her some groove time with Desiigner on MTV’s “Critique My Cover”. 
Ari's inspirations include the likes of Ms. Lauryn Hill, Alicia Keys, and Erykah Badu. However, her eclectic style is genre-bending--mixing folk, soul, r&b, and trap to produce a sound all her own.

75,Aries,"Aries is the solo electronic project of Isabel Fernandez, known as a composer and recording artist in band Charades, touring background vocalist for Delorean, as well as for her singing on Cartoon Network’s ""Adventure Time"". Isabel has been disobeying music all her life but it was in 2011, when she started her solo career, when we discovered that inside her head there was a melodic, kaleidoscopic, punk and unpredictable universe. A world in which Brian Wilson –in the melodies– and Leon Tolstoi –in the law-breaking final message– could happily walk hand in hand dancing to electronic rhythms. She called this personal project Aries (her zodiac sign) and under this identity she has already produced four albums. The latest one, “Juramento Mantarraya”, released by Spanish label La Castanya and K Records, is full of beautiful melodies, seemingly convoluted but at the same time very simple, where violins and flutes are mixed with abstract sounds. Aries creates an orchestra that generates an exciting mixture of free-jazz, soul and folk rhythms, melodies from the girl groups of the 60s, sunshine pop and experimental electronics.

77,Arkansas Dave,"It’s a romantic cliché to find an escape in music and the blues, but living that life is a different matter. Ask Arkansas Dave about growing up in a broken home, with fundamental Christianity on one side, and crippling drug-addiction on the other, and you can see in his eyes that this is no easy ride, and that at times music really was his only friend.
Chasing his dream of music, Dave played in bands, funding his music with a succession of jobs where he had to find his feet quickly – from busboy to assembly-worker in a trash-bag factory.
His wake up call came at the edge of a breakdown with a cataclysmic weekend epiphany. He headed home for a rare visit, and was persuaded to play a few songs to his family. The response he got from his grandfather sent his mind racing, only for him to find out the next week that his grandfather had died 24 hours later.
Determined to clean himself up, and sort his life, Arkansas Dave enrolled on an audio engineering course at Media Tech in Austin Texas, driving into town with a trailer loaded with all his possessions, ‘like something out of the Beverly Hillbillies’. And that’s where everything changed – the college was housed at that time in the f

78,Armani White,"SOMETIMES THE CUT DOES RUN THAT DEEP. 
For West Philly born, Armani White, that moment was at the age of 4, during a domestic violence episode between his parents. Screaming at the top of his lungs for the violence to stop, only to be heard by no one, Armani now channels that moment every time he steps to the mic. After uploading a 1:13-second video to YouTube titled “Stick Up”, not only would his voice be heard but amplified. The record would land him on the pages of Pigeons & Planes, MTV and go on to be spun on Pharrell & Scott Vener’s OTHERtone. He took a step back from music in 2016 after losing his father to cancer but later returned in 2018 with a standalone titled ‘Public School’ of the long-awaited EP Keep In Touch. The song appeared on Zane Lowe’s breaking list as well as many other Beats 1 radio stations. Later in the year, he popped back up with a Breakout set at Made In America and a Pop-Up Performance in front of 10,000 people at Colorado’s Red Rock Amphitheater where he previewed his newest effort,

79,Art d'Ecco,"Born in the misty backwoods of BC's Gulf Islands, there's little known of Pacific Northwest glam artist Art d'Ecco. His debut ""Trespasser"" (released Oct. 12th, Paper Bag Records) was a dynamic shot from nowhere - received with universal critical acclaim and wide-eyed wonder.  “Trespasser is not just chock full of swaggering rock ’n’ roll tunes that find the common ground between T. Rex, Sparks, Deerhunter and Ziggy Stardust and run with it in wholly satisfying fashion, but those songs are delivered by an enigmatic and elaborately attired auteur who takes the time to cultivate a proper peacock mystique alongside the music. Canadian indie-rock could use a bit more of that.” - The Toronto Star

82,The Artisanals,"Somewhere on a dusty road or a well traveled interstate, right at this very moment, a rock n’ roll band is pounding the rock. They’re probably wearing the same clothes they had on yesterday, and reminiscing about last night’s gig. Inspired by a guitar lick that cuts to the bone or a melody that lingers on refrain, this band is following a path forged by countless other musicians who’ve lived and died in dive bars or ‘made it’ with their posters taped to bedroom walls. What makes this band of brothers any different? This band is The Artisanals. 
When Johnny Delaware moved from small town South Dakota to Charleston, SC he met Clay Houle and bassist Eric Mixon to form The Artisanals in late 2016. Now, with drummer Nick Recio, and keyboardist Ian Klin rounding out the group, The Artisanals have dropped the first ever record to come out of the Magic Barn - an Iowa studio-converted-barn that features the Neve console and gear from NYC's now defunct Magic Shop Studio. Utilizing everything from gong, organ, piano, sitar, french horn, trombone, and koto, to a string section sourced from a nearby University, every song on 'The Artisanals' (Sept 2018) self-titled LP is a straight banger.

Opting for the new moniker Art School Girlfriend, her self-produced tracks - which explore themes of queer identity, lust and disillusionment - caught the attention of Grammy Award-winning producer Paul Epworth and she signed with his label, Wolf Tone Records (The Horrors, Glass Animals) in 2017.

87,Austin Lucas,"It’s been over two decades since the songwriter packed his bags and left Bloomington, Indiana, the Midwestern town where he spent his childhood years falling in love with rock n’ roll, embracing his punk roots, and standing his ground whenever intolerant locals didn’t understand his way of life. He returns to that place—both creatively and physically—with his latest album, Immortal Americans. Written after a tumultuous period that found Lucas getting sober, supporting his partner through a battle with cancer, and breaking up with his longtime record label, Immortal Americans is a clear-eyed album for murkier times, rooted in stripped-down heartland rock songs that find the artist reflecting upon the changes in both his hometown and himself. It’s also Lucas at his most honest, rooted in a string of largely unamplified anthems that don’t rely on electricity to pack a punch. “I was watching the changes in Bloomington and reflecting upon the changes in my own life,” he sums up.“ Not all of this is happy stuff, but there’s hope. There’s light in the darkness. I really do believe in second and third chances, because I know how many chances I’ve received. You have to keep fighting.""

Avalanche Party is feral garage rock & roll from the wild North Yorkshire Moors, hopped up on adrenalin and amphetamines. Their sound is intense and immediate, so new yet so familiar and brimming with an urgency that explodes off the stage like the front lines of a war you didn’t even realise was being fought. Every note played through white knuckles, every word spat through gritted teeth. The beats blast like cannons while the guitars stampede like spooked stallions surging ever onward, snorting, snarling and tearing apart everything in their path.
The past year has seen Avalanche Party tear away from the moors, raising venues all around the UK and Europe to the ground with intense live performances, including Reading & Leeds Festival and a headline performance at Isle of Wight Festival. Hotly tipped by many for big success the band has had heavy radio support, being championed by BBC Introducing, BBC Radio1, BBC 6Music, Radio X etc as well as KCRW and KEXP in the USA.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.",Rock,Garage,"Castleton, UK-ENGLAND",http://audio.sxsw.com/2019/mp3_by_artist_id/1a4f897f91d3ff7b9fcfe201b5179426458de5543220de6e5d0874beebdebc28.mp3,Avalanche Party at 720 Club,"Mar 12, 2019",12:00am-12:40am,720 Club

She enrolled at Georgia State University and majored in PR and journalism. “I knew I wanted to be an artist but I chose that because I could learn how the media would be.” In 2013, a cover posted to Instagram piqued the interest of songwriter/producer Mello The Producer. “He was the person who taught me how to record and taught me how to really be an artist.” She found a kindred spirit in Mello and the two cut several demos. “We have a bond musically.” Mello was working with August A

95,Azultrabuco,"AZULTRABUCO is a Colombian urban ensemble that mixes different Latin music rhythms like salsa, cumbia, cha-cha and boogaloo with the Latin-jazz. AZULTRABUCO got together back in 2005 by musicians from different regions of Colombia, all of them very well known players from several musical styles such as jazz, symphonic music, rock and Colombian folklore. This variety in its members gives AZULTRABUCO a rich and varied sound inside a urban style. The theme of his music is taken from the cotidianity of a city like Bogotá. Led by Carlos Rengifo, bassist, arranger and composer of great musical trajectory, AZULTRABUCO has developed an impeccable musical work that has led him to have presentations at national and international recognition festivals. AZULTRABUCO released its first musical production in 2012 entitled ""Calle Caliente"" which had a great welcome among the salsa public in Bogota. One of his singles called ""Bien Pegao"" was included in the compilation of the album ""SALSA DC"" from the record label MTM Records. They are  currently working on the production of his second recospotifyrd project that receives the name of ""Barrio Adentro"". Two  singles are already available on spotify.

97,BABii,"BABii is a small girl who makes big noises. When left unattended, she produces all her own beats, writes all her own words, makes all her own pictures and uses all her limbs and voice when she plays live. If not watched carefully BABii will write song after song, to the point where some have been put away for when she is older. The first of these songs will be heard on her debut LP ‘HiiDE’, out in 2019 on Deathwaltz Originals which was in parts co-produced by Adrian Sherwood and focuses on the key themes of hiding and secrets. Some tracks have already snuck out in strange forms on Iglooghost’s Diplo & Friends mix for BBC Radio 1 and have been heard while supporting him on tour around the UK. BABii recently made new friends with Iglooghost, umru, Kai Whiston and Abi Wade but having been left unsupervised they created more songs, some of which can be found on the internet, others of which are still HiiDDEN.

98,Baby FuzZ,"Doing what many only threatened to do, in 2017 songwriter Sterling Fox moved to Canada to protest the anti-environmental policies of the US government (among other things). A year later, he reemerged with Baby FuzZ, a bizarre alt rock/glam pop band with a rotating cast of contributors and members. Baby FuzZ's music fuses a number of styles from emo to rock and roll to creepy pitch shifted ballads. Described as “one of the most slept on acts in music” by Hillydilly, Baby FuzZ released a litany of brilliant singles in 2018 and drops a debut album Plastic Paradise on February 26. Baby FuzZ has also made a name as an enigmatic video artist, constructing some golden era MTV style music videos. Drawing comparisons to everyone from Billy Corgan to Elton John and Elliot Smith, it's hard to pin down exactly how to classify BF. In the past, Fox, the frontman of Baby FuzZ, produced “Video Games” by Lana Del Rey and has written for the likes of Madonna, Britney Spears, and Avicii, so there is a decidedly surreal pop sensibility to the weirdness. But with a charmingly punk ethos and a unique self produced album, Baby FuzZ just might be the strange new arrival the alt rock world needs.

99,Bad Bad Hats,"Bad Bad Hats is an indie rock band from Minneapolis, Minnesota. The band consists of Kerry Alexander, Chris Hoge, and Connor Davison.  Their music honors classic pop songwriting, with nods to 90s rock simplicity and pop-punk frivolity. Through it all, Alexander’s unflinchingly sincere lyrics cut to the emotional heart of things. The band's sophomore LP ""Lightning Round"", was released August 3rd, 2018. Producer and collaborator Brett Bullion (who also produced their debut album ""Psychic Reader"") encouraged the group to record live in the studio, an approach which lends many songs on the record a loose, organic feel. In this spontaneous environment, the music feels as honest and unpredictable as Alexander’s lyrics. Alexander is still writing love songs, ones that recount with cinematic swell the subtle joy and pain of the everyday. Bad Bad Hats has toured the U.S. extensively since 2015, including tours with Margaret Glaspy, Hippo Campus, Third Eye Blind, The Front Bottoms, and more.

After years knocking around the Washington, D.C. punk scene in bands of their own, guitarists Katie Park and David Combs, bassist Emma Cleveland and drummer Daoud Tyler-Ameen began playing together in 2015, with a few goals in mind: Songwriting would be collaborative, singing would be everyone's job and arrangements would be generously staggered, blending voices and ideas to avoid centering any one member.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.",Punk,Power Pop,"Washington, DC",http://audio.sxsw.com/2019/mp3_by_artist_id/190a74993a60444058f28fd12447c98ecab23b01f4cfcaaea0b2cb940a543740.mp3,Bad Moves at Malverde,"Mar 14, 2019",12:15am-12:55am,Malverde
101,Bad Sounds,"Bad Sounds- formed by Bristol-based brothers Ewan and Callum Merrett started out on different musical paths before Bad Sounds was born. Ewan made hip-hop beats and played with samples, while Callum was working in recording studios and obsessing over the music of Michael Jackson, Curtis Mayfield, Beck and Flaming Lips. Combining their different loves, Bad Sounds are conjuring their own unique pop magic.
Annie Mac picked five of the band’s songs as her Hottest Record in the World, and landed 3 BBC Radio 1 daytime playlist adds. It’s no surprise Bad Sounds are a firm radio favourite; their big pop anthems, brimming with huge choruses, hooks powerful enough to fell tower blocks, and inspiring lyrical messages, bear loud repeated listening. 
The band’s live show is becoming a word-of-mouth sensation as they turn every show into a full-on party, and creating a colourful subversive experience for the audience.

103,Bailen,"BAILEN’s other worldly musicality springs from a very deep well, in fact, it’s in their DNA. Raised in New York City by their classically trained parents, siblings Daniel, David and Julia Bailen (fraternal twins and younger sister, respectively) immersed themselves in a record collection that included Simon & Garfunkel, Joni Mitchell, Carole King and The Band. 
Even though they finish each other’s sentences, dissolve into laughter and tell hilarious contradicting childhood stories, BAILEN’s highly collaborative songs and visceral harmonies are formed by three very different individuals. They’re inspired not only by literature and a love of language, but also a myriad of classical and pop influences. Their musician parents didn’t push their kids. “They never said, ‘Guys, music is a viable option for a career,’” Julia explains. “I think they just showed us what the life of a musician was by example.” David affirms, “They normalized it.”

106,Balto,"""Balto sound like the kind of band you’d want playing in the background as you cruise down the highway with a road soda clutched in your hand."" - What Youth 
Following an ill-fated six-month stint as a copy editor and telemarketer in Moscow, guitarist and songwriter Dan Sheron returned to the US and recorded a record. The debut garnered the attention of dozens of blogs and publications worldwide as an underground songwriting gem of 2011. 
Over time, Balto transformed from a songwriting vehicle into a rock n roll band – performing a swaggering style of American music rooted at the intersection of Motown, Big Star, Plastic Ono Band-era Lennon, and Jackson Browne. Numerous releases followed upon which the band toured the lower 48, Alaska, Europe, and Russia and joined national acts (David Nail, The Revivalists, Blind Pilot, The Current Swell, etc) all over the West. Their live performance has drawn comparisons to fiery indie rockers My Morning Jacket and Wilco, while Seattle-based curators Artist Home describe 2017's LP Strangers as “a tangle of beautiful, messy emotions, wrapped up in a sound that’s warmly familiar yet brimming with soul and tiny details that are touched by magic.

107,Balún,"Brooklyn-based electronic indie band Balún self-identify as transnational. Balún’s sophomore album Prisma Tropical focuses an incredibly wide field of genres and influences into a revelatory sound that evokes both of the band’s homes and the distance between them. Heavy doses of tiple, bomba barrel drum, and dembow work alongside loops and layers of shimmering synths to accomplish something explicitly of the island, yet fluent in the language of global pop. Tied together around the magical realism of singer Angélica Negrón’s lyrics, Balún’s deep understanding of reggaeton's Jamaican dancehall roots has transformed their shoegaze pop into “dreambow.” Prisma Tropical was released July 20th 2018 via Goodchild Music and premiered on NPR’s First Listen. The album release saw Balún embark on a national tour including live recordings with KEXP and Audiotree. Prisma Tropical was one of NPR’s Top 50 Albums of 2018, placed #4 in Rolling Stone’s Top 10 Latin Albums of 2018, and The New York Times named “Años Atrás” one of the best 65 songs of 2018. In SXSW 2018 the band was selected as one of ""17 Acts That Stood Out"" by the New York Times.

As a three-peice comprised of twin brothers Blaze (drums) and Reid Bateh (vocals) and their childhood friend William Brookshire (bass), the band moved from Georgia to NYC to release their debut LP Dreamviolence, followed by Swarm in 2016. The significantly more expansive and refined sound captured on 2018’s Western Gothic concept album Shadow On Everything (Wharf Cat Records) has catapulted the band since its release.
Their pummeling, unpredictable live set has made them favorites in New York City. After opening for IDLES in Brooklyn, Bambara was immediately asked by the band to support them on their US tour. Additionally, Bambara has toured the US and Europe extensively alongside the likes of Metz, Girl Band, APTBS, Liars, Nothing, Algiers and more.

With the rugged power of a flashy Super Chief locomotive, the Banditos’ self-titled debut album bodaciously appropriates elements of ‘60s blues-fused acid rock, ZZ Top’s jangly boogie, garage punk scuzz a la Burger Records, the Drive-By Truckers’ yawp, the populist choogle of CCR, Slim Harpo’s hip shake baby groove, the ebullient folk of electric Dylan, gut bucket Fat Possum hill country mojo and the Georgia Motherf**king Satellites. From backwoods bluegrass, to slinky nods to Muscle Shoals soul and unexpected bits of doo-wop sweetness, the Banditos recall many, but sound like no one but themselves.

Barrie, the band, is primarily her project; on the record, which she co-produced with Jake Aron (Snail Mail, Solange, Grizzly Bear), Lindsay plays guitar, piano, synth and bass. But still, Barrie is distinctly not a solo project, and Happy To Be Here—out May 3, 2019 via Winspear—is very much a full band record. 
Happy To Be Here offers snapshots of the band coming together in the city, after having lived all over: Boston, Baltimore, upstate New York, London, São Paulo via Berlin. “The scaffolding of this album is moving to New York and finding these people that make up the band,” Barrie says. “We’re very different, but we cover each other’s gaps personally and creatively, and are eager to learn from each other.”

As a practicioner, Mr. Blakes is a curriculum and instruction specialist whose facilitation of teaching and learning via writing, reading, listening, and speaking extends beyond classrooms to school and community assemblies, concert venues, workshops and events serving youth, men, teens, and families, as well as faith communities. Accordingly, Austin mayor Steve Adler proclaimed April 23, 2015, as Bavu Blakes Day to a capacity crowd at City Hall.

123,bbymutha,"bbymutha is Chattanooga-based rapper & an absolute female force of nature, getting nods from Erykah Badu, Björk, Earl Sweatshirt, SZA, & Kehlani.
bbymutha's joins Southern rap’s legacy of originality, by choosing local flairs, non-apologetic attitude, & candidly blending life experiences into hard-hitting bars — pointedly brandishing her sexuality in the face of respectability politics & unapologetically celebrating women for their ambition, savvy, sexuality, & vulgarity.  
The result is a soundscape all her own—a slow, ice-cool Chattanooga drawl rapping through the distorted & progressive production from Suicideyear, London’s God Colony, & LSDXOXO— earning her features on The New Yorker, Pitchfork’s 10 Rappers to Watch 2019, Pitchfork’s The Best Rap Albums of 2018, Vibe’s Best Female Rap Albums of 2018, and FACT Mag's Rappers to Watch 2018.
Her sharp + provocative lyrics (openly sexual, feminist, & positive) leisurely wrap around experimental electro beats. bbymutha is part of a new wave of pantheon underground female rappers, such as Noname, CupcakKe, Tierra Whack, & Rico Nasty, challenging a still male-dominated genre. 
bbymutha's debut album, Muthaland, is out April 2019.

128,Bedouine,"Bedouine, a gallicized riff on bedouin, the nomad, the wanderer. Anyone can assume such a name, but Azniv Korkejian has an experience of what it means, the type of ground it covers. “Moving around so much caused me at some point to feel displaced, to not really belong anywhere and I thought that was a good title.” Her development was shaped by political landscapes and family opportunities, her adult life patterned by paths of her own. Born in Aleppo, Syria to Armenian parents, Korkejian spent her childhood in Saudi Arabia, moving to America when her family won a Green Card lottery. They settled in Boston, then Houston, but she split for L.A. as soon as she could. A casual offer to stay on a horse farm took her to the rolling hills of Lexington, Kentucky, followed by a year in Austin, and a trip east to Savannah for a degree in sound design. Returning to L.A., she discovered a close-knit community of musicians in Echo Park that started to feel like home. Maybe America is just a highway that leads back to L.A.
Korkejian works with sound professionally, in dialogue editing and music editing, a slice of Hollywood’s sprawling industry. She never set out to be a singer in L.A., taking a

Keller and Dosier share instrument duties, swapping between vox, keys, guitar, and percussion, the end result a lo-fi creep-rock experimentation at the intersection of brash and melodic. Sharing a passion for blood and darkness explored through a playful sound, the duo offers a fresh look at hell.

Listeners can hear the influence of contemporary song-focused rock bands in their recordings and on stage. They like to get creative with synths and spacey/acid guitar sounds and vocals that stretch them into Pink Floyd territory.

Bandcamp Daily describes Beacon's tape release This Is Fine (2017) as ""layering brisk plinky riffs, glassy beats, and insistent rhythms into one dizzying mix, making it as ideal for meditative headphone listening as for cutting loose at an Algorave.""
She has performed in clubs and at festivals across the UK and northern Europe, including BlueDot festival and the 2017 Berlin Transmediale, and her work is currently featured in the Open Codes exhibition at the ZKM Museum for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany.

Started in late 2010 in a bedroom in upstate New York, Bellows has since blossomed from a solo recording experiment into a large-scale rock band, employing the help of friends to bring Kalb's intimate home recordings to life on stage in sweeping, loud, and intense live performances.   Bellows has been writing and self-producing records for the better part of the last decade, recording four full length albums and multiple shorter collections of song-a-day projects in the years since their naturalistic 2011 debut As If To Say I Hate Daylight. Bellows' ambitious sophomore album Blue Breath was recorded over the course of three years in several bedrooms across the United States, and was named in Bob Boilen of NPR's Best Albums of 2014 list. 2016's synth-heavy Fist & Palm meditated on the ending of a friendship and was named twice in Stereogum's 100 Best Songs of 2016 list.

Dickey’s acting debut in Blaze, Ethan Hawke’s biopic about doomed Texas singer-songwriter Blaze Foley, has already led to more roles, including their pairing as bounty hunters in The Kid, a western directed by Vincent D’Onofrio. But just as exciting, as far as Dickey’s concerned, is the opportunity it provided to record with that musical hero, longtime Bob Dylan guitarist Charlie Sexton (who played Blaze’s other troubled Texas songwriting legend, Townes Van Zandt). After they did the film’s original cast recording (on Light in the Attic Records), Sexton produced Dickey’s solo album, A Glimmer on the Outskirts.

Alluding to an existential period in his career while living in Berlin, Beshken effortlessly coalesces elements of indie, experimental dance, ambient, psychedelia and dream-pop. Synth and bass sounds in the single “Cursed” are noises from the echochamber-like geodesic domes of Teufelsberg, a Cold War-era listening station just outside the German capital. Exploring the point where acoustic recording and digital rendering meet, Beshken’s new work is an effective lesson in how field recordings, synthesizers, and introspective lyrics can fuse into a challenging, yet accessible format.

With excellent musicianship, very danceable rhythms and a large dose of humor, Beto and the Fairlanes became enormously popular among a surprising mix of music lovers. Dancing to Beto beneath the stars at Liberty Lunch became a truly 
""Austin experience”. The legendary venues of that time such as ""The Armadillo World Headquarters,"" ""Liberty Lunch"" and ""Soap Creek"" provided the catalyst for local bands like ""Beto"", Stevie Ray Vaughn"", ""Asleep At The Wheel"" and ""Jerry Jeff Walker"" to develop Austin's own unique style and culture. This incredible hot bed of artists, in turn, inspired the creation of the groundbreaking music show ""Austin City Limits"". From these fertile beginnings, the popularity of Beto and the Fairlanes continues to grow. Now 40+ years later, they continue to delight concert audiences and pack the dance floor!

(There's also shades of Lou Reed, The Minutemen, and Violent Femmes.) Big Bill formed in 2011, though the seed for the band was planted years earlier, when the Braden brothers spent countless untrained hours piecing together music in high school. Even as the band's ambition grows, that Outsider Art element to their music lives on.

147,Big Cedar Fever,"Big Cedar Fever is a string swing band out of central Texas that specializes in Western swing and jazz. Three part harmonies and tight musical arrangements draw listeners in, only to be taken away by the classic style and lyrics that recall another time and place.
 
Formed in January of 2018, the trio includes Georgia Parker on jazz-box guitar, Ian Lee on fiddle, and Nick Lochman on the upright bass. With all three sharing vocal duties and trading instrumental solos, this is a group whose constant harmony is right up there with their prowess as a dance band. The up-and-comers have played host to crowds of Lindy hoppers, Texas two-steppers, and Western swing dancers. In their short time together they have also been at home in listening room environments, providing intimate sets that showcase a true love for the history of the music.

Africa is everywhere in Brazil, and it pulses through the music on Quebra Cabeça (Puzzle), Bixiga 70’s second studio album for Glitterbeat, where two continents dance together across the black Atlantic.
The result still captures the incendiary excitement of Bixiga 70 live, but the freedom of the studio brings more shade and subtlety than before. The rhythms are more sinuous than ever, snaking through the funk in way that looks more to Ghana or Nigeria than Memphis or Muscle Shoals, while the horns strut in powerful harmonies. It’s music that forges connections and retraces history while sounding absolutely contemporary. But for Bixiga 70, African will always be the root, and Brazil its beautiful, vibrant flower.

Eventually drawing parallels between christianity, voodoo and the occult, he left the former to immerse himself in the latter. Sometimes performing with a vibraphone and cassette decks, he frequently employs the use of cassette tape loops and other antiquated mediums to create pillowy worlds of wow and flutter.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.",Hip-Hop / Rap,Avant / Experimental,"Dallas, TX",http://audio.sxsw.com/2019/mp3_by_artist_id/ea63e30e58183eb6aec5cf27fb94f10a39f2353c9813e5950cf8bc15c3793b4b.mp3,Black Taffy at ScratcHouse,"Mar 14, 2019",8:00pm-8:45pm,ScratcHouse

His sound has constantly been expanding and evolving since; twisted yet nuanced autotuned voices float on top of dark, angelic beats with an abundance of bass, lethal melodies and broken down rhythms as proven on standout solo album “Eversince”, released in 2016. Bladee unveiled his second studio album ”Red Light” in early 2018, a release followed up by a sold-out show at O2 Academy Islington in London plus him taking the helm as creative director for Yung Lean ́s Sadboys Gear brand shorty thereafter.

177,Blessed,"Formed in the early winter months of 2015 in British Columbia’s Fraser Valley, Blessed were born from a shared creative objective. From the start, its original four members found themselves naturally amalgamating elements of Post-Hardcore, Minimalism, New Wave, Krautrock, and Punk. To date, Blessed has released one single with Toronto's Buzz Records (Weaves, Dilly Dally, Greys), and two critically lauded EPs. The Fader wrote of the EP II: ""Dominated by the high-fructose riffing pioneered by Deerhoof, giving way to a darker, propulsive jam that's just as chaotic, yet well-controlled.""

Four out of Blessed’s five members cut their artistic and organizational teeth in a fiercely D.I.Y. community that developed in the most unlikely conditions. In the Fraser Valley’s sprawling collection of suburbs and farmlands, there is little cultural infrastructure. And there is even less municipal enthusiasm for the arts. It is a Lynchian setting that nurtures overt conservatism and covert creativity. Young Valley musicians were forced to creatively accommodate their burgeoning local music scene by whatever means available. They turned the basements of shared punk houses into venues.

179,Blood,"Blood is a jazz punk band from Austin, Texas that began in Tim O'Brien's Hyde Park bedroom in the Winter of 2017. After years of performing poetry and singing in experimental projects, Tim took to the bedroom with the sole intention of making a tape for his best friend in the grips of a long battle with depression. The result feels like an adolescent, whose broken into the Pentagon just to piss on the carpet and fulfill a uniform fetish with his father’s colleagues.
It is the collision...ahem collusion... of these dual energies which has ultimately expanded the project into a five piece jazz punk ensemble. At times the band sounds like the Talking Heads fronted by a murderous queer Black Francis. In other moments it sounds like Ian Curtis convinced that he sounds like Dionne Warwick; a crooning epileptic in a balladeer's ballgown. In a more general sense, the members of Blood have been brought together by a mutual instinct to curate a perverse love affair between noise and pop music.
Regardless of how much vitriol the band has allowed to seep from the stage, one can at all times feel a greater sense of militant naivety which guides the bands every move.

Bloods had a massive 2015, showcasing at SXSW, touring the US alongside fellow Aussies The Preatures, and naming themselves the first Aussie band to sign a publishing deal with Sub Pop Publishing. They also shared the stage with Sleater-Kinney, Wavves and Peaches. 
Taking on a much broader palette of influences ranging from shoe-gaze to 90s indie-dance, their 2018 sophomore album Feelings was recorded with producer and friend Liam Judson (‘Bliss Release’ Cloud Control/ ‘Hope Downs’ Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever) in the games room of Liam’s parents’ house in NSW’s Blue Mountains. 
During the ‘Feelings’ campaign the band supported Veruca Salt, Alex Lahey and WAAX across their Australian tours, and supported Cloud Nothings and Rolling Blackouts Costal Fever in Sydney.

Her debut single, ""In My Head,"" was produced by prolific NYC electronic duo The Knocks (Carly Rae Jepsen, Foster The People, Big Boi). Born and raised in New York, Blu takes inspiration from the city's rebel culture in the '70s. Her first live performance was a Rolling Stones tribute show at the iconic CBGB club, the testing grounds for Blondie and Talking Heads to name a few. This early experience provided the foundation for Blu's commitment to a career of bohemian experimentation, no fucks given DIY attitude, and affection for all things glitter. Blu picked up the bass at 7 years old. She quickly educated herself and mastered bass lines from songs by Prince, Sly and the Family Stone, and CHIC. Messing around on her Dad's Technics turntables helped spark her youthful interest in DJing. At 17, Blu started DJing clubs around the city, becoming a fixture at House of Yes, underground warehouse parties, and pop up fashion events. Blu currently studies at NYU's Clive Davis and is also a touring member of the alt-rock band Kitten.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.",Dance,Pop,"New York City, NY",http://audio.sxsw.com/2019/mp3_by_artist_id/abdaf6898204dd431adc6a8fd368aa6a6fb14ecc19a3f1a0d4a0e5587a5def8c.mp3,Blu DeTiger at Empire Garage,"Mar 12, 2019",8:05pm-8:30pm,Empire Garage

Their debut EP ""Tether"" was self-released in 2017, followed by their EP ""Weak"" on Austin Town Hall Records in January of 2018. Gaining infectious momentum, Blushing have since been asked to play Athens Pop Fest and have shared stages with the likes of La Luz, Sunflower Bean, Broncho, Snail Mail and more.
Their latest single ""The Truth"" showcases a growth in the band's expansive, cascading sound laden with ethereal vocals and fervent guitar, simultaneously capable of reining in with emotional and melodic space.

It's a DIY affair, founded not too long ago that earned them favour quickly amongst their favourite bands, industry and beyond.

It  goes  like  this:  Sophie,  after  a  period  living  in  New  York,  found  herself  in  Sydney  with  a  handful  of  Garageband  demos  needing  a  beat.  Enter  Cecil  –drummer,  old  friend  and  fellow  Perth  native  –  who  had  also  decamped  to  Sydney.  They  met  Annabel  soon  after,  and  were  completed  when  Georgia,  another  Perth  survivor,  joined  on  bass.  The  quartet  played  their  first  show  in  late-2016;  less  than  a  year  later,  they’ve  played  main  support  for  cult  heroes  Japandroids,  opened  for  luminaries  like  Frankie  Cosmos,  Big  Thief  and  The  Coathangers,  and  played  Gizzfest  and  Sydney  Festival  and main support for POND.

Youthful Tel Aviv quintet Bones Garage marry post-punk aesthetics with surf rock accentuations to create a luscious melodic sound that occasionally threatens to spin out of control.  
Formed in 2014 when vocalist Ariel was recruited by the former members of the band Grey (who themselves had enjoyed moderate regional success), the new band wasted no time playing their first show just a few weeks after forming. They haven’t looked back since performing anywhere and everywhere possible.
Don’t be fooled by the band’s relative young age, BG are unafraid to breach heavier topics referencing social justice, the plight of the modern man and basic human emotions. Dramatic, emotional and hard hitting; the ideal soundtrack for a post-apocalyptic party.
The band's debut international single “Birthmarks"" is the first single from the band’s full length ‘Massacre/Dance’ that is available in digital via Bandcamp.
The band have played Glastonbury Festival, Great Escape festival in 2017, and play All Points East festival in May 2018.  The band is currently working on her second album, ""Oi Ma Yeah"", which will be available soon.

197,Booher,"In a city where most of Austin’s lyrical depth is tied up in the postpunk and in the country scene (presumably), Austinite Michael Booher carves out a space of emotional literacy into a chronically indifferent scene, carving letters to a lost love like one would carve letters of fidelity into a playground tree. Pensive and uplifting, debut album Funny Tears is all the fist pumping good times of an all-American band steeped in the golden age of jagged catharsis –a continuation of the best days of storied alterna-something-something largely thought lost and not to be heard from again. Carrying on the hallowed ground where Replacements, Pavement, Springsteen, and the Afghan Whigs would pitch their tents for at least an evening, Funny Tears is satisfyingly tangled up in a man often at odds with himself, yet welcoming, warm and universal enough to pull in the most unlikely visitor. Or to pull up an old friend out of the dumps and tell them there’s always a way.

201,Boy Azooga,"Boy Azooga’s  is piloted by Davey Newington, a young man with much musical heritage. One of his granddads was a jazzer who played drums for the Royal Marines. Davey’s dad (violin) and his mum (clarinet) both played, and met, in the BBC National Orchestra Of Wales. Davey himself also enjoyed orchestral engagement, playing in various Welsh Orchestra’s and Jazz bands as a teenager.
Davey’s vocals and arrangements carry the tunefulness of The Super Furry Animals. But the palette extends far beyond singer-songwriterly poignancy. Davey recruited friends Daf Davies, Dylan Morgan and Sam Barnes to form the Boy Azooga live quartet, an ensemble that swings smoothly from filmic instrumentals to a churning, rave-tinged rock that hints at both Can and their progeny in Tame Impala.

202,Boy Scouts,"Taylor Vick makes music that is instantly comforting and arrestingly beautiful. Under her songwriting moniker Boy Scouts, the Bay Area artist has spent over a decade refining her craft, penning heartbreak confessionals over glitchy drum loops since Myspace days. It wasn't until 2015 that Vick put together a live band and became a staple of San Francisco and Oakland lineups.
On her forthcoming album, it feels like Boy Scouts has truly arrived. Recorded and produced by Stephen Steinbrink, every element exists purely to serve the songs - the bass lines bounce and guitars are lush, but nothing gets in the way of Vicks true superpower, her voice. Delicately layered harmonies exude an effortless grace, and make the most casual lyrics hit the hardest. There's something so honest about her songs, they feel like late night therapy sessions with your best friend.

Newski has played over 1200 shows on every continent except Antarctica. Most recently he's been supporting Violent Femmes, PIXIES, Chuck Ragan, & New Pornographers in the US. 
His latest LP, ""Life Upside Down"" was produced by Hutch Harris of Sub-Pop & Saddle Creek legends The Thermals and engineered by Beau Sorenson (Death Cab for Cutie, Superchunk, Bob Mould), ""Life Upside Down"" is a beautiful catharsis to a happier brain and sense of belonging. If you frequently find yourself stuck in your own head traffic, this record might help get you free.
Brett Newski has certainly kicked his own ass over the past 6 years, touring infinitely (mostly alone) and wandering down the rabbit hole of anxiety, depression, and wallowing self-doubt. All of these negatives have blossomed into positive creative energy on his third LP. 
""Anxiety can actually be a good thing. If you use it right, that nervous energy can be channeled into motivation or creativity,"" explains Newski.

Then the Briefs burst onto the scene like a neutron bomb with the audaciously titled “Hit After Hit” and the punk rock landscape was changed forever.
Their ’77-style pop punk is loud, raucous and fierce, yet cohesive and hooky and hilarious. The Briefs are like a team of Chinese acrobats falling down the stairs on purpose. And when I say “pop” I mean popular in the broadest sense possible. The fifteen year-old mall hottie is a fan, but so is the 40 year-old stalwart with the pristine Undertones collection. Sure The Briefs wear their influences on their sleeve – Adverts, Buzzcocks, Weirdos to name just a few — but they cop to them like junkies caught tying off in the alley with a skinny tie. They can’t help it. It’s in their blood. Listen you’ll understand. The groove is familiar but they’ve got a sound that’s all their own and uniquely unique. Infectious? Once they get in your ear, there’s no getting them out. The Briefs are mother fucking nerve agents for a diseased life.

Following the catchy, playful vibe of previous albums Can’t Get Past the Lips (2011) and Just Enough Hip to Be Woman (2014), as well as the deliberate sonic intent of 2016’s sludgy, moodier art piece Double Vanity, the new record reveals BRONCHO’s fly-on-the-crumbling-wall vision of our moral climate, complete with a reenergized, accessible sound and the charmingly sardonic, smiling-while-sneering delivery of singer and bandleader Ryan Lindsey.

213,The Brother Brothers,"The Brother Brothers are Adam and David Moss, identical twins carrying on the folk tradition for a new generation. Using minimal instrumentation, heartfelt lyricism, and harmonies so natural they seem to blend into one beautiful voice, the siblings draw on the energy and creativity of Brooklyn, New York for their full-length debut album, Some People I Know. 
The Brother Brothers’ acoustic project emerges from several years spent traveling the country, both separately and together, playing in varying ensembles and sometimes settling in separate cities. Though each writes his fair share of the discography independently, the brothers’ palpable fraternal bond produces a togetherness in these songs that few bands can offer. 
Although young men, The Brother Brothers have boasted this sterling folk sound for decades. Growing up in Peoria, Illinois, they sang along as children to their father’s record collection of the Kingston Trio, the Everly Brothers, the Beatles, and the Beach Boys. “That's where we learned to sing harmony and then one thing leads to another,” says Adam. “All of a sudden we could harmonize to anything we wanted to. It was a very natural progression.”

With that simple introduction, so opens one of the year's most immersive and adventurous rock albums, Eternal Reach. The debut LP by Birmingham, Alabama, band the Brummies – their name is U.K. slang for a resident of Birmingham – Eternal Reach is a musician's album, distinguished by inventive arrangements, lush melodies and straight-to-tape production. Perfectly suited for losing yourself beneath a pair of quality headphones, the record evokes the psych-rock vibe of the Sixties and the soft indie-folk of the Nineties, yet possesses a timeless sound all its own.
Made up of vocalists and multi-instrumentalists John Davidson and Jacob Bryant, and drummer Trevor Davis, the Brummies have been playing together in various incarnations since high school. The members count the Beatles, Elton John, ELO, Blitzen Trapper and My Morning Jacket among their influences, but also have an affinity for sweeping film soundtracks, a passion that informs Eternal Reach.
Recorded at Battle Tapes Recording in Nashville with engineer Jeremy Ferguson and co-producer David Hopkins, Eternal Reach now serves as the Brummies' stunning calling card.

219,Buck Gooter,"Finer Thorns is the Buck Gooter’s 18th album in 14 years, and second for independent Philadelphia label Ramp Local. The duo -- self-described as a ""primal industrial blues band"" -- has managed to gain the recognition of underground luminaries like Henry Rollins, and has toured both the United States (every year for the past 14 years) and Europe with A Place To Bury Strangers, Guerrilla Toss, The Sediment Club and ONO - their live shows are possibly even more energetic than their breakneck recordings. In performance, vocalist/synthethist/percussionist Billy Brat will flail around the room, brandishing his iconic serpent-like facial expression -- tongue out, eyes rolled into the back of his head. Terry Turtle dawns his signature mask and chain mail, his acoustic guitar hangs low around his neck and is adorned with a hallucinatory painted finish; he's a stoic figure while Billy thrashes about the stage.
Musically, Buck Gooter's sound is filled with manic howls, melodic synth sequences, crisp and pummeling drum machines, and highly distorted guitar, resulting in a cacophonous punk-industrial haze a la Nine Inch Nails, Iggy Pop and Grinderman.

223,Bugz Gutta,"Born and raised on some of the darkest streets of Virginia, Hip hop rapper, Bugz Gutta is no stranger to trouble.  Before he officially began his rap career he spent nearly ten years in and out of the prison system. While navigating through a life of crime, he quickly gained a special appreciation for Hip-hop and all of its healing powers. Unlike many adolescent children, he was never very entertained by the tall tales of Mother Goose.  Instead, he spent many sleepless nights lying awake studying the underground mixtapes of the artist who someday would become rap royalty.  It was those stories shared by rap artist like The Lox, Cam’ron and Lil Kim that seemed to most reflect his life experiences and eventually inspire his music are still spinning on his play list today.  He is a hardcore, no nonsense, gutta style rapper who is open and honest about being sexually attracted to both men and women, however, he is far from just another gay rapper. Self-titled, “Hip Hops Omar from the Wire” this young ambitious rapper takes no prisoners.  Shortly after moving to the NYC he went full speed ahead in the booth working on music day and night.

Nothing is held back, all is laid bare. To see BUHU perform is an experience so intimate that it feels almost illicit—like peeking through a window and witnessing a private moment you’re not meant to get to share. Rogers exudes true feeling on stage, bounding freely and dancing with the microphone, moving himself to the point that his legs buckle underneath the weight of all the emotion and fatigue. He wraps the mic cord around his neck like a noose, seemingly choking himself to get these words out. Meanwhile Paciga, like a goddess Rogers can never quite reach, holds court stoically, majestically, to the side, her throne an array of synths, drum machines, pedals, samplers, and loop stations, which she orchestrates like a conductor, weaving a musical tapestry that’s lush, sexy, and utterly captivating. The juxtaposition of the two performers together is impossible to look away from. It’s music you know somebody’s getting lucky to, whether you happen to be one of those lucky ones or not.

226,Bully,"Fronted by Alicia Bognanno, Bully was born in 2013. Bognanno was an engineer who had cut her teeth working at Electrical Audio in Chicago. Their debut album received unanimous critical acclaim and Bognanno became a point of intrigue–a rock icon in the making, with her signature scream, messy blonde hair hanging in her face, with formidable skills as both a player and engineer who prefers recording to tape. 
While ""Feels Like"" tumbled headlong into the precarious nature of Bognanno's young adult life, ""Losing"" is a document of the complexity of growth: navigating breakups with sensitivity, learning not to run away from your troubles but to face them no matter how messy they may be. ""Losing"" is an internal, carefully focused record, a universalized diary and an exorcism–not of any one specific demon, but the host of them that characterize contemporary anxieties. Bully are growing up, sure, but their fire is in no way diminishing.

My sound is fragmented and abstract, but also dreamy, driven, dark and clean.
I am interested in music, which shows the algorithms used to produce it. My genre is a mix of minimalistic electronic music, sound art and alternative pop. I perform my music as a live coding session.
I was born and raised in Berlin and grew up studying art and physics while immersed in Berlin’s clubbing scene. I started making music by programming and soldering little synthesizers. 
I released a vinyl record last year, as my first release, a conceptual work, which features sounds generated from some of my black glass sculptures which I sonified through a synthesis system I built. 
I live between Berlin and L.A.
Last year I performed in a lineup with Lady Starlight and DJ Koze, which I loved to see happen and I have performed my work at the big European art + music festivals such as CTM Berlin and Ars Electronica in Linz. 
I am asked frequently to speak on the future of music and AR, VR, XR, AI at international conferences.
For the visuals I currently collaborate with the digital artist Dlareme.

233,The Cactus Blossoms,"Blood Harmony. Whether it’s The Beach Boys, Bee Gees or First Aid Kit, that sibling vocal blend is the secret sauce in some of the most spine-tingling moments in popular music. The Cactus Blossoms – Minneapolis-based brothers Page Burkum and Jack Torrey – offer compelling evidence that this tradition is alive and well, with a deceptively unadorned musical approach that offers “creative turns of phrase, gorgeous harmonies, and an ageless sound” (NPR All Things Considered), not to mention spine tingles aplenty. Their 2016 debut You’re Dreaming, a stunning and transporting collection of original songs, earned high praise from Rolling Stone and Vice Noisey, tour stints with Kacey Musgraves and Lucius, and a perfectly cast performance on the third season of David Lynch’s Twin Peaks. Now their unlikely rise continues with new album Easy Way, to be released on their own label Walkie Talkie Records.
While many bands would have been content to stick with the winning formula of their debut, the Blossoms refused to repeat themselves. If You’re Dreaming celebrated their vintage country and rock influences, Easy Way reveals a songwriting style that has changed, evolved, and gotten more modern.

234,Caleb Brown,"Twenty-year-old rapper Caleb Brown is already a promising new independent voice in hip-hop, with how he depicts his hometown of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to devastating effect in his “Batonstan” series. Yet his fifth EP BROWN shows how he has an even clearer sense of self today. “I’ve broken my shell and had a self-esteem boost,” he says. “I can finally be me.”
During high school, Caleb Brown first imagined that he would grow up to be a basketball star, but his grades failed to qualify him to play. Then a friend urged him to listen to Nas. “I studied Illmatic for the longest time, trying to mimic his storytelling capabilities,” Brown says. The teenage rapper was also coming to terms with how mental illness can affect one’s outlook: After watching his mother work as a nurse aid in group homes, and essentially growing up in such facilities, Brown was diagnosed as bipolar, as he spells out in BROWN’s second track “Mob” without a trace of irony. 
Caleb Brown graduated from high school to a record deal with Rostrum Records and an idea for what he had to offer. “I didn’t want to be Kendrick anymore. I didn’t want to do what Nas was doing anymore. I wanted to be me.

The group then began to tour up and down the east coast in support of their first release. A year later, the band released a more polished EP titles “Juice EP” through Egghunt Records. The lead single and title track “Juice” made its way into a Consequence of Sound article and quickly became Camp Howard’s most popular track. The bands efforts were rewarded in the summer of 2018 with a support tour opening for Stone Temple Pilots.

Refusing to adhere to the paradigms and principles of hardcore, punk, metal, pop, or whatever label the listener has tried to affix onto them; they’ve created a space all their own.
Candy has once again teamed up with Triple B Records for their most fantastical and sinister release yet. Keeping in line with the artistic dualities of pleasure and pain, fact and fiction, peace and violence, their debut LP Good to Feel delivers 9 songs of their most ambitious and focused material to date. Aligning with the esteemed engineer and producer Arthur Rizk, Candy has finally achieved the type of artistry that transcends the confines of its own medium. Where they once dabbled in the marriage of noise and image, Good to Feel succeeds in its pull from deep cinematic wells. Environmental devastation, police violence, political corruption, and a myriad of tragedies privy to the human experience all make their way into the vaudeville demonstration that is Good to Feel.

“I want people to feel proud of what they have,” Canon says. “You can have a little or you can have a lot, but there’s hope either way.”
The 10-track project is made up of hard-hitting production and smooth melodies as Canon weaves together bouncy anthems like “Flex” and “Pac-Man” with the introspective title track where he teams up with ethereal singers Mogli and Eris to drive the message home.
Canon’s own journey of defining “home” started in Chicago, where he moved around a lot, but found stability, security, and a sense of belonging with his family and church. He started attending a youth group called “The House” when he was a teenager. This is where he first came to know the Lord and began exploring his passion for rap. From there, Canon attended college in Memphis, where he had to take ownership of his identity when his peers called him “too ghetto” or did not understand the culture he came from.

She pumped her music full of details from an early adulthood spent in the company of the heartbroken and high-toleranced. In 2015, McHone released Goodluck Man which earned her a cover story in The Austin Chronicle as well as the support of local icons like Ray Wylie Hubbard, who said she ""writes songs like her life depends on it."" Then she hit the road, touring the U.S. (and beyond) with acts like Shakey Graves, Gary Clark, Jr., and Joe Pug. Her writing style widened and her music evolved. 
“There was a time when I wanted to champion traditional country,” says McHone,  “mostly because I wasn’t hearing it in what was being called ‘country’.  I think a lot of roots influenced artists feel the need to defend tradition in this way.  Today though, I want to do more with the form, push myself past

Carthy are currently excited to be in the studio finishing a great new full length album. Our influences range from classics like Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Paul Simon and Queen to newer artists like Twenty One Pilots, Lorde, Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga and The Killers.
Chase, the eldest, is nicknamed “Brains” for his vast knowledge of music theory. He produces, plays guitar, plays keyboards and sings.
Drew in the middle, learned to play guitar in high school for the sole purpose of being able to play John Denver songs.He is the band’s resident lyricist and also sings.
Seth, the youngest,  got his start in choir. As a classically trained bass vocalist, it’s no surprise that he was able to quickly pick up playing bass for the band. “If we buy you a bass guitar, do you think you could learn our entire set list in time for the show next week?” was his rite of passage into Carthy.

Her next single, ""GhostShips"" received a genre nomination in the Pop category from the Hollywood Music in Media Awards and received an Honorable Mention Award by the USA Songwriting Competition. Her newest single, “Letters”, which was recorded, produced, and mastered in Tulsa is Casii’s beat-driven rock response to the frustration of dating in the digital age: “It’s difficult having a lot of small talk, trying to connect with someone, but nothing happens."" This is Casii's first fully self-produced single.

250,Cassandra Jenkins,"New York City based Cassandra Jenkins, a songwriter who “knows how to leave an impression” with “elegantly celestial climaxes, emerald green-glowing guitar work”(P4k), released her first full-length album, Play Till You Win in 2017, followed last year's Live in Foxen Cayon. The cosmos in Cassandra’s self proclaimed Cosmic American songs are both macro and micro, with nods woven throughout to Hollywood-and-Vine country surrealism in a tapestry that is “tender and trance like” (Interview Magazine). What makes her collection of songs stand out from fellow acolytes of psychedelic burritos and dusty journeys through gilded palaces of sin, is that her vision and scope of influences are broad, idio-syncratic and ever-changing. Cassandra uses the clarity and smoldering sense of longing conveyed by her “smokey vocals” (NPR) to transcend her urban surroundings in order to connect to a deeper, quintessentially American vein of expression that showcases a sophisticated art heart and a mature point of view about the masks and complications of desire.

Consisting of four cousins & their best friend, the group began playing live during their teenage years & took their band name from a plaque mounted outside their grandfather’s house, one they later found out referenced the Irish village his family had emigrated from. Much like the band’s music, their name possesses deep personal meaning while still retaining an air of evocative mystery, hinting at places they’ve never been but still somehow course through their veins. Australia’s in their blood, too, and Sydney will always be home, but after signing with Concord Records, the band took a leap of faith in early 2018 and moved to the US. One listen and you’re hooked, sucked into their rapturous world of angular guitars and hypnotizing grooves. With a sound this meticulous and infectious, it’s hard to believe that the band has only just released their debut album, but the album is only the tip of the iceberg from a group that’s doggedly determined to fulfill every bit of their seemingly limitless potential.

254,Casual T,"  Casual T is making big changes in the world of electronic music.  In a scene filled with generic producers, Travis Drews thrives on bending genres and… just making good music.  Armed with a sound that draws influences from future bass, funk, and trap music, the up-and-coming producer continues to disrupt the EDM scene by performing both DJ sets and with a live band.  
       Travis’ relationship with bass music began in 2012, when both of his lungs collapsed due to the air pressure from the subs at an EDM festival.  Despite this injury, Travis still decided to dedicate his life to making music in the same year.  The talented DJ/Producer began as a turntablist based in Austin, Texas, where he quickly became a go-to in the local Hip Hop and Electronic scene.  Casual T has enjoyed success by performing at X Games 2015, Official SXSW Showcases in 2016 and 2017, and Waterloo Music Festival.  The His debut EP, “Lovers?” is set to drop in 2019, which will soon be followed by its sister EP, “Fighters!”.  Equipped with a Master’s in Business Administration, this young musician is poised to take over the world with his infectious sound and charisma.

255,Catastrophie,"Why do we wear masks? To do and say things we otherwise could not. Catastrophie is not a band, exactly: it’s a front, led by one woman’s voice through kinetic, fluid tracks. The collaborators have known each other since childhood, and are finding new ways to get under each other’s skin. With that deep familiarity comes peril—how do you say what you’ve never been able to say before?
One answer comes in the music of Catastrophie, which finds the means for both confession and remove, tragedy and irreverence, lightness and friction. The songs are stratospheric, fueled by the pressure of holding in emotions that aren’t allowed out, but float back to earth to confess the tenderest needs. The choreographed live shows veer into improvisation and infectious dance, and the videos are buoyantly glib—but dead serious.
If Catastrophie is a mask, a mythical feminine who fears and invites chaos, it’s a mask that allows her to be startling in her directness, and to deliver lyrics with unaffected candor and a hint of wounded malice.

It’s that feel, that deep emotional intuition that fuels Cautious Clay’s sound. Blending R&B, hip-hop, and experimental indie, his productions are dark and engrossing, built upon a unique combination of organic instruments, digital programming, and soulful vocals. He writes with unflinching honesty, engaging in deeply personal self-reflection with boldly vulnerable and vividly poetic lyrics. At times recalling contemporaries like James Blake or Sampha, Cautious is a profoundly modern songwriter and a forward- thinking producer, but he’s also steeped in the past, quick to cite Burt Bacharach as an idol and credit Stevie Wonder and Quincy Jones as ever-present influences in his artful arrangements.

“I used to think about songwriting and production as completely separate,” he explains, “but when I learned how to merge those two things, that’s when I was able to start creating music that really connected with people.”

After riding the wave that a pair of albums and half a decade in the indie rock spotlight brings, the group—the work of twin brothers Zach and Ben Yudin—found themselves facing an uncertain future after losing key parts of their infrastructure. Seizing upon the opportunity to make a change, they responded by injecting a new vibe into their bread and butter sound, resulting in no less than the album of their career.
Having burst upon the scene in 2012 with their debut, Bigfoot, Cayucas quickly earned all the spoils for which a celebrated indie upstart could hope. Following two and a half years of heavy touring, they released their second album, Dancing at the Blue Lagoon, in 2015, a slightly moodier but no less infectious affair. It represented a creative step forward for the band, and while its level of praise never quite equaled the fever pitch for their debut, fans enjoyed the Yudin’s growth as songwriters and the record’s emotional depth. As they took time to begin preparations for the next record, they were also faced with the task of finding

Cece spent time in Nigeria at an all girls boarding school but soon moved back to the states to finish grade school in a suburb of Austin, Texas. Cece later dabbled in drug dealing in high school, usually selling weed and other part drugs to friends and associates.
Around this time is when Cece also began to start writing her own songs and making crude recordings off her computer microphone. 
After high school Cece continued to hustle on the side and was able to pay her bills and purchase a car from money made in the streets of North Austin. This money also helped her put together better equipment for her own studio and paid for studio times at other established places around town.
Today Cece’s style and music has came along way from computer mics, having her video featured on SayCheeseTV. Cece shows no signs of slowing down and is sure to be a big asset in the Austin/Texas hip hop as well as the LBGTQ hip hop scene!

The 39-year-old still lives on several acres not far from the Holly Springs, Mississippi, home where he was raised by “Big Daddy,” his grandfather, the late singer/songwriter/guitarist R.L. Burnside whom Cedric famously played with, just as his own father, drummer Calvin Jackson, did.  Cedric was literally born to the blues, more specifically, the “rhythmically unorthodox” Hill country variant which emerged from Mississippi, where he grew up surrounded (and influenced) by Junior Kimbrough, Jessie May Hemphill and Otha Turner, as well as delta musicians T-Model Ford and Paul “Wine” Jones.
Grammy-nominated in 2015 for Best Blues Album for the Cedric Burnside Project’s Descendants of Hill Country, as well as the recipient of the Blues Music Awards honor as Drummer of the Year for four consecutive years, Benton County Relic offers a showcase for his electric and acoustic guitar, recording 26 tracks in just two days.

277,Chastity,"Chastity is a world of its own from the mind of Brandon Williams. Reflecting the working class background of Whitby Ontario, Chastity’s songs are charged with the ethos of archetypal youth on the fringe.
It was clear from the release of Chastity’s first demos that this was not “another punk band that can operate at only one speed.” Always concerned with the trending lack of accessibility and inclusivity in public spaces for the arts, the first Chastity show was held in Williams’ own bedroom where, packed wall-to-wall, the police were quickly called. But after the project’s second show supporting DC punk band Priests, Chastity was off to the races, sharing stages with the likes of with Metz, Chelsea Wolfe and Fucked Up. All without a full length recording out.
Released summer 2018 with Brooklyn Label Captured Tracks, 'Death Lust' follows the plot of suffering to survival. The album begins on a tortured note with ‘Come’ and builds toward the plummeting finale of ‘Chains’, evolving from start to finish in a crescendo of severity. Pitchfork calls Chastity's music 'the Smashing Pumpkins if they’d signed to Dischord'.

But as singer/guitarist/founder Clementine Creevy began writing the first of some thirty songs that would make up the new Stuffed & Ready, she found unexpected inspiration by turning inward. That meant leading her band somewhere new and writing songs that would reveal aspects of herself she realized she’d once concealed. 
Apocalipstick sizzled with Creevy’s confidence, vision and fiercely idiosyncratic personality. Stuffed & Ready announces Creevy as a songwriter newly tempered and strengthened by coming to terms with her own uncertainty confusion and anger. It’s her go-for-broke honesty that gives Stuffed & Ready its power and gravity. “I am telling my story of how I feel and where I am in life,” she says. “I’m exploring my own self-doubt. I’m confused about what happiness is and I’m searching for my place in the world. With Apocalipstick, I was an over-confident teenager trying to solve the world’s problems.

The Chills produced a number of critically acclaimed recordings such as the single “Pink Frost” (their first hit) from the compilation album Kaleidoscope World and “Wet Blanket” from the LP Brave Words. Joining influential labels Creation and Homestead, they then moved to Warner Brothers imprint Slash and onto the world of majors.

Born to a working-class blue-collar family, Chris struggled to find the middle ground between his grandfather’s Southern Baptist sermons and the honky-tonk mystics that he discovered on old vinyl records in high school. Armed with an old thrift-shop guitar, Chris began playing and writing stories about life from a unique but oddly familiar point-of-view. Songs about liquor stores, truck stops, low-rent motels, and the grifters and transients that frequent them. It doesn’t matter if it’s a pool hall or a theater, a festival or a front porch, Chris’s live sound is the whiskey-laden prospectus that anyone with a struggle can relate to.

Currently, Bofale is rediscovering herself as a 22-year-old living in Austin. For Bofale, it’s time to reclaim her roots and make space for those who still find themselves on fringes of rock music. Her sound fuses hints of the Congo into various aspects of her music, bridging the musical influences of the diaspora with juxtaposed elements of indie rock, soul and jazz respectively. With influences like Joni Mitchell and Alex G, Bofale has found a sweet spot for her sound that lives between both harsh and gentle terrain, achieving a relaxing, yet rugged tonality. As she so eloquently puts it “it’s dreamy in the back, but hits hard in the front”.

303,Cimafunk,"Cimafunk is by far the most exciting new face in Cuba’s music scene.
Cimafunk is a cimarrón (fugitive slaves who settled in the wild to lead a free life in Cuba), a free being defying classification, a pilgrim in search of new musical miscegenation and the reunion of black music. He believes in nothing but the power of the Groove and the cathartic communion of dancing bodies. A renaissance man, conscious of his roots and musical ancestry, Cimafunk’s music looks firmly into the future.  
Singer, composer and producer, Cimafunk offers a subtle and bold mix of funk with Cuban music and African rhythms, a life-affirming sound, a UFO in the island's music scene.
His debut album ""Terapia"" (Independent Production, 2017) and especially his electric live shows are inexorably conquering a multitude of audiences from Havana to Paris. He broke attendance records in iconic venues such as the Fabrica de Arte Cubano, El Sauce and La Tropical.
Cimafunk is the winner of the Havana World Music Festival “Primera Base” Contest. In 2018, he was awarded the Cuerda Viva Awards (category “New Artist”) and his videoclip for “Me Voy” was elected Most Popular Video of the Year for the Cuban Lucas Awards.

308,Claire George,"Claire George is a songwriter with wide eyes and a natural sense of wonder. Across her material she combines that cosmic curiosity with an imaginative sense of melody and uniquely swirling electronic productions. Claire’s voice may be familiar to some through her work as a vocal topliner in the electronic space, or as the lead singer for San Francisco act HEARTWATCH, but this project sees Claire turn her focus inward. Seeking space and seclusion, she left the Bay Area in 2016 for a quieter setting outside Seattle where she lived alone for two years. Though isolating, the solitude proved rewarding and Claire was able to find and refine her voice in the process. She emerged with the Bodies Of Water EP, released in November 2018 on Cascine, an undeniably strong batch of material made all the more wondrous with each repeat listen.

309,Claire Morales,"""...All That Wanting takes on a theatrical sweep and rock & roll edge as Morales delivers her dusky ruminating with a quaver somewhere between Joni Mitchell and Kate Bush."" - Rolling Stone
Listen if you like: Angel Olsen, PJ Harvey, Mazzy Star.
Born to a family of artists and musicians, Claire Morales began playing music and making visual art at a young age. By middle school, she was performing her first solo sets at coffee shops, armed only with her father’s 1960s Gibson J-45 and a voice that many well-meaning people throughout her life would deem “more powerful than I thought it would be, looking at you.”  
Morales went on to form a band, making a sharp shift towards rock n roll while keeping a love for lyrics and a strong singer songwriter sensibility. In 2018, she released her second full length album, All That Wanting. There is a vast sonic range across the work—a kind of genre defying fearlessness, passing fluidly between moments of intense drama, fuzzy psychedelia, poppy fun, quiet reflection, and cathartic release. Morales toured the US with her band last year to promote the new album with plans to tour more in 2019.

311,CLAVVS,"CLAVVS is a duo of accidental best friends. Amber Renee and Graham Marsh might never have met if not for a last minute text invitation to a stranger’s house party. Soon they were writing the songs that would become their first CLAVVS releases. Two albums later, Amber and Graham have dialed in their sound, one that merges his obsession with world music sounds and hip hop drums with her imaginative lyrics and off-kilter pop melodies. The result is both familiar and otherworldly, a distinctive sound that has earned the duo praise from Consequence of Sound, Earmilk, and The 405, who calls CLAVVS “indie hitmakers.”
Despite their often dark and hypnotic sound, there is something hopeful and human in their music. Amber and Graham are energetic and emotive, unafraid to move to their own rhythms. Perhaps that makes sense, as Amber grew up performing in musical theater and singing original Americana songs while Graham spent years on the major label side, earning 4 Grammys before walking away to find a place in the industry that felt more human. CLAVVS is just that— an alternative pop band that examines human experiences with candor and imagination.

After grinding it out in the Austin music scene for several years and experimenting with different sounds and ideas, Collin had the opportunity to go on tour with Black Joe Lewis filling in for his regular guitarist. While on tour, Collin witnessed firsthand the power that a well-crafted song could have on an enthusiastic, packed house. He discovered that it’s all about creating something visceral; something more felt than heard – that it's all about the song.

Their first full-length album Unuudur heden on be? Noyon Tagtaa (How many years ago? Mr. Pigeon) was released in 2014. The record got both critical acclaim and popular support with its strong songwriting, pulsating and funky rhythm, and refreshing guitar sounds.

While true to producing the sophisticated, ‘colorful’, and up-to-date sound, it has sought and will seek to create the unique songs and music. They will keep expressing the desires, aspirations, and everyday lives of young Mongolians who mostly live in the rapidly-changing and cosmopolitan atmosphere of the urban spaces of Ulaanbaatar that is unfairly perceived as the periphery of popular music in the planet.

Comprised of Carolina Oliveros’ mesmeric contralto, illuminating storytelling and fierce guacharaca rhythms, Prince of Queens’ hypnotic synth stabs and grooving bass lines, Niño Lento’s imaginative guitar licks, and Dilemastronauta’s powerful drumming, the lure and lore of Combo Chimbita comes into existence.  
The legend begins with their first EP, 2016’s El Corredor del Jaguar, and followed up with the occult psychedelia of Abya Yala. In 2019’s Ahomale, the New York-by-way-of-Colombia troupe fuse the perennial rhythms of the Afro-Latinx diaspora with a modern-day consciousness, while tracing the prophetic traditions of our ancestry. “The more we’ve played music together, the more we began to discover things within ourselves that we were previously unaware of, almost like a energy. And that’s being communica

327,The Comet is Coming,"Debuting music from their forthcoming Impulse! records release (March 2019) The Comet is Coming is the soundtrack to an imagined apocalypse.  
In the aftermath of widespread sonic destruction what sounds remain? Who will lead the survivors to new sound worlds? Who will chart the new frontier? In a warehouse somewhere in London 2013 a meeting would take place between three musical cosmonauts. They would pool their energies to build a vessel powerful enough to transport any party into outer space. 
It is after the end of the world, the stage is a spacecraft, the mic is an accelerator, brace yourself for The Comet is Coming.
The Comet is Coming are King Shabaka, saxophone, Danalogue keyboards and Betamax drums 
“Powered by Arkestral cosmic forces, The Comet Is Coming. Brace for impact” The Guardian  
“The Comet Is Coming embraces stargazing psychedelia, outfitting spacey synth arrangements with taut saxophone riffs that spiral off into the inky abyss” Time Out, New York

And Construction & Destruction started in about 2005, or so.  We’ve been together for more than half of our lives, and currently work out of Port Greville, Nova Scotia, where we’ve lived since 2003 in an old house by the sea.  We keep things yar by sharing song-writing, instrumentation, art and production duties.  And all other general rock and roll duties.  We seek to put to song the universal grammar of the heart, and record, ourselves and others, in the Quarantine: our living-room studio.

332,Control Top,"Covert contracts rule our world: manipulative relationships, encoded social norms, opaque technologies. “With a covert contract, the trick is that the agreement is only known by the person who makes it,” says Ali Carter, vocalist/bassist of Philly post-punk trio Control Top. On their debut full-length Covert Contracts, out April 5th on Get Better Records, Carter with guitarist/producer Al Creedon and drummer Alex Lichtenauer rip open space for catharsis. Their explosive songs, co-written by Carter and Creedon, blend no-wave inspired dissonance and the melodic beauty of pop, delivered with the immediacy of punk. At once anthemic and chilling, Covert Contracts puts words to today’s unspoken anxieties. Brimming with post-punk poetry for 2019, it’s the sound of agency being reclaimed. Following SXSW, Control Top join Laura Jane Grace & the Devouring Mothers and Mercy Union for a six-week tour of the US and Canada.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.Artist is seeking the following professional connections: Label, Management, Brand Partnership, Gear Endorsement, Distribution - US, Distribution - UK/Europe, Distribution - Worldwide, Other Artists to Tour With, Booking Agent - US, Booking Agent - UK/Europe, Booking Agent - Worldwide, PR/Publicity Agency, Producer/Studio Engineer, Publishing, Sync/Music Supervisors",Punk,Post-Punk,"Philadelphia, PA",http://audio.sxsw.com/2019/mp3_by_artist_id/b4752fb432603ec653623b498586152e6dd4be07c4e8eac497b73b17ff74c2f3.mp3,Control Top at Mohawk Indoor,"Mar 14, 2019",1:30pm-2:00pm,Mohawk Indoor
333,Cory Kendrix,"“In the three years between Kendrix’s last release and Me Right Now, the singer uprooted himself to Colorado, physically leaving behind the already geographically fractured LNS Crew for new opportunities and some semblance of maturity. Kendrix explains in Me Right Now’s liner notes that the work is “an open window into my life” the product of a stressful move and the struggles of dealing with “the insecurities of a relationship and fatherhood, of following my dreams while juggling real life.” The EP’s predecessor Worth Something hinted at those insecurities as well, and paved the way for Kendrix to abandon hip hop braggadocio for self-loathing R&B but Me Right Now and Kendrix’s rebranding make it something more permanent and evocative.
Kendrix makes this change apparent not just in the more melodic vocal approach but in the claustrophobic emotional intensity of every facet of the production, from the raw, blunt lyrics to the hurt and wounded feeling of the music itself. The aptly named “Pain” hits with the density of a throbbing toothache, Kendrix’s voice quavering over seismic bass and gasping samples.” - Nick Hanover (Ovrld)

336,Cosmico,"“Nothing that matters has happened, but I think it will,” a lyric from Cosmico’s forthcoming album, written in the fallout of a motorcycle accident that cost Greg Denn, the bands lead singer, his left foot and broken bones.
But in the words of Leonard Cohen, ""There’s a crack in everything, that’s how the light gets in.” 
Greg battled the long upward road of rehab and it was basic traits such as strengthening his hand mobility that lead to strumming again on an old electric guitar. Realizing he was finally making progress both physically and musically; writing bouncy 80s melodies and fluid 60s vocal lines that really encouraged his desire to make recovery his number one priority.  
Two years on, in 2017, approx. one month into walking again, Greg and Cosmico took to the stage and played their first show at Stubb's in Austin, TX.  Local Grammy Nominated music producer Chris ""Frenchie"" Smith was in the audience and he heard something special in this indie rock outfit. Frenchie took the band under his wing and made it his mission to help mold the sound and record the band at his studio, The Bubble. 
Cosmico's debut LP, ""Overthinker Know It All"", was released on vinyl Feb 22, 2019.

Now with a new album named Country Kingz out it has a host of features including Kirko Bangz. Country Cousins is on the verge of reaching what many said would be impossible.

339,Coven,"When Relapse reissued the Pentagram back catalog, many people believed that American doom's patient zero had finally been given its due. But dig deeper, and you'll find an even more mysterious nugget with an origin story that seems to defy history. On the sunset eve of the sixties, as flower power was wilting and the winds of change blew a cold breeze over Altamont, a Midwestern rock group called Coven struck the first chords of major label satanic rock. But the story is even stranger than that...
Coven's debut album from 1969 kicks off with a song called ""Black Sabbath."" The bass player's name on that record was Oz Osborne. These coincidences are almost inexplicable, especially considering the UK album debut from the Sabbath we all know wasn't released until February 1970.
The second side of Coven's debut LP, Witchcraft Destroys Minds & Reaps Souls, features a full ritual. This is ground zero for occult rock, and many have followed its bloody footprints in the snow... 
Coven was the artistic outlet and brainchild of Jinx Dawson. She was well known for her dead serious satanic beliefs, her succubus beauty, and her thrilling voice. In 2019, it's de rigeur to play occult-influence

341,The Crack Pipes,"Veterans of the late-90s early 2000s garage wave The Crack Pipes have remained active in the vibrant Austin club scene overcoming boomtown venue closures, failed labels, the loss due to fire of their studio home base and guitarist BillySteve's cancer diagnosis in 2007. The influences range from noise rock icons like Gun Club and Grant Hart to modern garage rock acts Viva L'American Death Ray Music, Reigning Sound, The Golden Boys and back to mid-60s groove and R&B like The Grassroots, T.K. Hulin, Johnny Rivers, and Tommy James. Fake Eyelashes is the band's first new album since 2007's Beauty School (Emperor Jones, reissued in 2017 on Super Secret Records), and it will be released on Austin's Super Secret Records. It picks up right where the band left off, carrying the torch for great, under the radar rock 'n' soul. Much like underground lifers like Dead Moon or The Flamin' Groovies the band keeps marching to its own unique beat bucking the current trends and tropes of contemporary music.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.Artist is seeking the following professional connections: Booking Agent - UK/Europe",Rock,Garage,"Austin, TX",http://audio.sxsw.com/2019/mp3_by_artist_id/6ae94e9d5ff75a5aab729bd99cdc020e545c69ccd82ea7820bf08f8d147522cb.mp3,The Crack Pipes at Beerland,"Mar 13, 2019",8:45pm-9:15pm,Beerland

A pair of film school dropouts who burst onto the New York scene with a perfect single and a darkly retro sound, the band’s first two albums play like noirish documentaries on a lost girl group. Four years after Static, Cults returns with Offering, an exciting collection of songs bursting with heart, confidence, shimmering melody and buzzing life. The time off has given the band new energy and new ideas–Cults are working in Technicolor now. 
The core duo remains the same. Madeline Follin and Brian Oblivion, both 28, still live in New York. They still finish each other’s thoughts and still share a love of catchy music and black humor (this is a band that sampled cult leader Jim Jones on their first hit). But the pair have put some blood on the tracks since their breakout debut: they’ve toured the world, built a devoted audience, survived a breakup, grown up in green rooms, parted ways with their old label and made a home of their new one. After the whirlwind of Static died down, Follin and Oblivion made a conscious decision to shift gears:

The musicians that make up Dallas hip-hop group Cure for Paranoia have their own bold energy and personal styles which would best be described as aggressively funky. Between Tomahawk Jonez’s and JayAnalog’s production, Stanley Francisko’s airy vocals, and Cameron McCloud’s brisk lyrical delivery, the band has designed its own brand of “trippy soul-infused hip-hop.”
The group formed when the four guys took a “doomsday road trip.” Following the advice of some conspiracy theorist friends, they packed up and headed to an ideal place to wait out the apocalypse. When an earth-shattering meteor didn’t hit, inspiration did. Having recently been diagnosed with bipolar paranoid schizophrenia, McCloud found clarity in making music with Analog, Jonez, and Francisko. By the time they returned home, the band was born.

In the following months, Cure for Paranoia quickly made a name for themselves and were awarded Dallas Observer’s Best New Act. They formed a relationship with Erykah Badu and began touring and recording.

The Harvard Crimson reported, ""The Curls are a fun, nostalgic sextet whose genre fluidity necessitates a string of hyphenated descriptors—art-funk-jazz-psycho-punk-pop-rock doesn’t even cover all the bases."" 
An impressive and widely regarded performance at Pitchfork Music Festival 2018 has led to a growing and unstable fanbase. The Curls have shared stages with popular music greats like Tame Impala, Courtney Barnett, Maps and Atlases, Post Animal and Texas Fred. The group's 2017 record SUPER UNIT received approval from legendary guitar rocker Adrian Belew (King Crimson, Talking Heads). Belew raved typing in all caps via Facebook Messenger, ""I LIKE IT!""

Mackey has recently launched a self-titled alternative/electronic project that debuted at the 2016 COLD WAVES FESTIVAL in Chicago.
 
Curse's sound fuses post-punk, dystopian electronics with doom-fueled drones, seductive synth pulsations and industrial dance club beats that evoke the ghosts of early Skinny Puppy, Lustmord, Coil, and the iconic projects Mackey has been a part of.   He is currently completing his solo debut album ‘Instant Exorcism’ which will be released to coincide with his 2019 tour schedule which includes dates supporting My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult as well as iconic dark wave legends Clan of Xymox.

355,Curse Of Lono,"Curse Of Lono released their second album ‘As I Fell’ in August 2018. Produced by Oli Bayston (Boxed In) at Rancho V in Joshua Tree, California and Flesh & Bone in London, ‘As I Fell’, entered the Official Americana Albums Charts at No. 10 and the Official Independent Albums Breakers Chart at No. 15 in the UK. 
‘As I Fell’ builds on the band’s deeply cinematic blend of harmony-laden Americana and driving, gothic alt-rock. It’s a sound that owes as much to old faithfuls like The Doors and The Velvet Underground as it does to more modern practitioners of the form such as The War On Drugs and Wilco. 
The album has been accompanied by a short documentary 'Somewhere In Their Heads' which has won Best Short Documentary at the LA Edge Film Awards and the Changing Face International Film Festival in Sydney.
Curse Of Lono, who formed in London in 2015, are Felix Bechtolsheimer (vocals, guitar), Joe Hazell (lead guitar and vocals), Dani Ruiz Hernandez (keys and vocals), Charis Anderson (bass and vocals) and Neil Findlay (drums).
Curse Of Lono received the prestigious Bob Harris Emerging Artist Award at the UK Americana Awards in January.

361,Da Chick,"It’s easy to stumble on the idea that listening to Da Chick is like travelling back in time: maybe to that New York era where Disco and Punk, New Wave and Hip-Hop would cross styles and shake the dance floors. Nothing wrong with that idea: there’s a lot of that classic Boogie spirit, with a strong passion and straightforwardness, a sassy attitude and a groove drinking from the best sources. 
But if it’s true that listening to Da Chick is like travelling back in time, we should also think about the future as a mark for what this artist presents us: it’s a future where female creativity and freedom are not questionable at all and where this electronic dance, made in Portugal, still has a lot to give and inspire worldwide.
Da Chick carries her name and image: new releases, but also design, styling, videos...  And on stage, alone or escorted by a full band, Da Chick makes sure you get the message on who’s the funk machine: her powerful and lightning live shows granted her a win for Best Live Performance Award in Portugal, to be invited by Peaches to sing on her show, and to open for massive Funk legends like Earth Wind and Fire and Maceo Parker.

362,Daddy Long Legs,"DADDY LONG LEGS return with savagery and sophistication on their upcoming Yep Roc debut, Lowdown Ways. The 12 original tracks punch a necessary hole in the 21st Century landscape, both sonically and spiritually.
The expansive, new territory that the New York City-based trio cover on Lowdown Ways is thanks to producer Jimmy Sutton (JD McPherson Band) who applies his technical know-how to broaden the sound of such instantly memorable tunes as “Pink Lemonade” (co-written by McPherson), “Ding Dong Dang” and “Bad Neighborhood,” which resonate with the down-and-dirty roots that have always been DADDY LONG LEGS’ inspiration. Meanwhile, the band ventures successfully into unfamiliar territory with the pub-rock-style “Winners Circle,” the bittersweet acoustic ballad “Back Door Fool” and the dramatic album-closer “Wrong Side of the River.”
Written in the great cities of Brooklyn and Nashville and recorded on the Southside of Chicago at Hi-Style Studio, the beloved trio have created a record cinematic in scope that rides the crest of the new century with a beggar’s banquet of  spells, hollers, rapturous preaching, and of course, DADDY LONG LEGS stompin’ beat.

rap legend Jesse Dangerously roared their appreciation – that tastes pretty good! Is there more! – and Lizard said yes I have got more. I’ll make more. There is more.
A wise old owl said they were influenced by Aesop Rock and Ramshackle Glory, and that the album they made together sounds like “if Drake listened to Neutral Milk Hotel.” It’s true they paid the owl to say this, but that doesn’t mean he was lying. Money words can be true ideas. He even said they could “chance the shape of Canadian hip-hop to come” but gosh, who knows?

368,Daniel Brandt,"Daniel Brandt, co-founder of acclaimed German ensemble Brandt Brauer Frick, released his second solo album Channels with Erased Tapes in October 2019.
The seven-track LP is Brandt’s biggest statement yet, with the album’s thrilling avant-garde framework interweaving chord-driven techno, orchestral flourishes, rich electronic textures and hints of dark cinematic pop. Following on from 2017's Eternal Something, which captured a contemplative kind of isolationism, with Channels Brandt set out to create an album that captures the essence of minimalism whilst lending it to a more playful context. 
After performing and recording Steve Reich’s Six Pianos in a group of six, Brandt began regularly composing long meditations on the piano, something that permeates the sound of the new record. Its frenetic energy and shape-shifting identity was also born out of touring with his new band Eternal Something — comprised of Brandt on piano, drums and synthesisers, Pascal Bideau on guitar and bass, plus Florian Juncker on trombone — and a desire to translate both the sound and spiritual unity of their live shows in which musicians locked together to create an intriguing meld of expansive works.

The band includes Daniel Francis Doyle (also of Deep Time); Luis Martinez (Horse Plus Donkey, Deep Time); and Nemir Naayem (Basic). Their new EP, “Unrecognizable,” is a cassette release available on Austin’s Self Sabotage Records. The EP’s peculiar romantic ballads were recorded and mixed in Austin at BUG SOUND with producer Paul D Millar (SLUGBUG, Ariel Pink, Gary Wilson). The group recorded the “Unrecognizable” EP live in one day with some of the vocals being recorded live as well. The songs were usually rhythm-based before being fleshed out and written as a band. The result is seven strikingly original songs, an emotive blend of post-punk & power pop at once jubilant and pensive. The first single, “I Had To Do It,” is also the first track; like much of the EP, it features a relentless pulse provided by Martinez’s electronic drum kit and Naayem’s synthesized bass. Doyle’s throwback guitar parts and overwhelmed vocals don’t attempt to blend in so much as stand out. Much of the Dreams’ strength lies in their pulling in three wonderfully chaotic directions,

The Automator sound is unique, an eclectic yet deliberate storm of burr and jangle, spattering off slow-grinding plates of rhythmic bedrock and slashed through with unexpected flashes of light and heat. It’s the sound of new creation; the sound of the end of the world. It has sent acts like Gorillaz, Cornershop and Kasabian to the top of the charts, and it has turned visionaries like Kool Keith and Del tha Funkee Homosapien into underground legends.  
 
Inspired by the soul and R&B music he heard on a neighbor’s radio, he began collecting records, and eventually, to DJing at parties in order to support his vinyl obsession. In high school, after hearing Malcolm McLaren and World’s Famous Supreme Team’s early dance/hiphop collaboration “D’Ya Like Scratchin’,” Nakamura began experimenting with turntablism, until an encounter with two emerging superstars — DJ Qbert and Mix Master Mike — led him to realize he’d never be able to reach their pinnacle of ability. He turned his talents instead to producing new beats

376,Darkbird,"I wanted to be here
I wanted to behave
But it's so hard tonight
Lyrics to the first song Kelly and Brian would ever write together set the stage for the romantic waterloo that would become Darkbird. 
Kelly Barnes left Los Angeles after a broken marriage resulted in a broken band. Just prior to the move, she unexpectedly hit international success, singing a monster hit called, “Get Shaky” with DJ Ian Carey. While the track and a few others were financially significant to the ex-wife and waitress, the style of music was unfulfilling to Barnes. She began to dread performing the songs and eventually became fearfully depressed.
After a tragic house fire in NYC, Brian Cole opted for a fresh start. As his belongings smoldered in the winter snow, he decided to pack up what was left and head south in search of warmer days and better luck.
Ironically, while most go to LA or NYC to make their dreams come true, Brian and Kelly found each other on the musician page on Craigslist in Austin, TX. While they had hoped to leave their pasts behind, inevitably, the heartbreaks found a place they call home in Darkbird.

378,Darling West,"Darling West is on NPR Music’s annual 100 to watch at SXSW 2019!

They have already won a Norwegian Grammy, been booked to some of the biggest festivals in Norway, toured the US and played festivals such as AmericanaFest, Folk Alliance International and Four Corners Folk Festival. In 2018 they released their third album “While I Was Asleep” worldwide on Jansen Records, and one could hear a slightly different and revitalized Darling West. Relentless touring and playing big festival stages has served as a catalyst to give them more edge and confidence. While continuing to play their sweet Americana/Cosmic Folk, the music has more drive and the melodies are catchier than before. 
The album received great reviews from Uncut Magazine, Greil Marcus in The Village Voice, Classic Rock Magazine, Americana UK, Folk Radio UK, Belwood Music, Americana Highways and many more. As No Depression put it: “They are a perfect example of how Americana has infected the rest of the world, and they play it with great affection.”

379,Darren Eedens & the Slim Pickin's,"Darren Eedens is a Honky Tonkin’ Americana inspired Banjo and Guitar player. Hailing from Ontario Canada he now calls Cardiff Wales home. Together with his band of Slim Pickin’s, he uses his unique and powerful voice to captivate anyone within earshot. With an unmatched live energy, they share his views on life and more often death, shedding a beautiful light on the tragic tale. Darren Eedens and the Slim Pickin’s have been bringing fun energetic Americana to festival stages all around Europe and the UK, they have people up on their feet from the first note picked, right down to the absolute silence during ballads of love lost. Having toured much of Europe for a number of years as a solo performer, Darren put together a strong band of musicians that also wanted to turn the idea of Country and Roots music on its head. They pack as many notes in tune as they can and have created an albums worth of music that will be recorded and released in April 2019.
With big songs, heartfelt lyrics, and ripping fiddle solos this is not a band to miss.

380,Das Body,"Out of the greyer climes of Oslo— particularly East Oslo with its drizzly expanse of apartment blocks and gas stations stocked with Kent cigs and smut mags— has suddenly come a burst of color by the name of Das Body. Ellie, Kim, Patrik, Didrik— all four were born and bred in Norway and have become fast friends making music that is listenably and undeniably pop, though just a little iffier— pop that feels like a newly-thrifted favorite T-shirt: comfortably worn, slightly sunfaded, and with a cigarette burn on its sleeve. Das Body is writing pop music without the sentimentality that oversweetens so much currently on radio rotation. Instead, to their vulnerability, they mix in a little vulgarity, or a little light-heartedness. After a few years deep in the studio, they have now emerged with already plenty of buzz from local fests and press, and their debut EP released in September 2018 on Luminelle Recordings. Das Body brings a uniquely Nordic odd-pop that is, nonetheless, destined for charts the world over.

381,David Boring,"Formed in 2013, Hong Kong, David Boring is named after the unlikely hero from American cult classic graphic novel David Boring. Musical influences of the band include punk, post-punk, noise, no-wave and industrial. Signatured with their dirty, experimental noise, male-female interlacing spoken dialogues and the occasionally violent live performances, DB explores the murky modernity with a ferocious postmodern skepticism, creating a dark, borderline claustrophobic world that either excites or traumatizes. 
Since the release of the album in 2017, DB went from being an under-the-radar local cult favourite, to slowly reaching out to a more international audience. They were named by i-D, as well as Dazed and Confused magazine, as one of the top 5 bands from East Asia to watch out for. Fueled by a unique blend of unflinching ferocity and poetic eloquence, the band was also featured in the late Anthony Bourdain’s last episode of Parts Unknown, where they were introduced to an American audience.
DB is Laujan (vocal), Jason (guitar), Stan (drums) and Yat-Wa (guitar).

382,David Keenan,"To describe David Keenan’s music, I previously offered this: “Not just another young lad with an acoustic guitar, Keenan is the sound of Tim Buckley and Brendan Behan arguing over a few jars a suspicious hand of cards, and Anthony Cronin and Jack Kerouac furiously try to scribble it all down.” He has grown into the character that he created - the tab-end tapping corner boy with the poet’s soul.
At odds with the music of the age, compressed as it is to an inch beyond its death, Keenan’s music beguiles you in, his lyrics akin to half-remembered barroom wisdom, that, days later, suddenly makes epiphanic sense. His art remains in a constant state of flux, whether it be sung to an acoustic guitar, delicately played with the small string section currently known as The Organics – navigating the hitherto unexplored hinterland between Nick Drake and Seán Ó Riada - or unleashed with his raucous Unholy Ghosts. 
Like Dylan, Bowie or Prince before him, Keenan is almost too prolific, songs tumbling from brain to pen. By the time you get to hear what he’s doing, he’s already somewhere else.
This is soul music.

As a student at Harvard, Wax began traveling south of the border to study and immerse himself in the country's traditional music and culture. Back in Boston, he met fiddler/singer Suz Slezak, whose love of traditional American and Irish folk music fused with Wax's Mexo-Americana into a singular, energetic blend that captivated audiences and critics alike. Their 2010 breakout performance at the Newport Folk Festival made them the most talked-about band of the weekend, with NPR hailing them as ""pure, irresistible joy."" They released a trio of albums that earned escalating raves everywhere from SPIN and Entertainment Weekly (who described them as sounding ""like Andrew Bird with a Mexican folk bent"") to the New York Times and The Guardian (which dubbed the music ""global crossover at its best""). They earned an invitation to return to Newport, this time on the main stage, as well as dates supporting The Avett Brothers, The Carolina Chocolate Drops, Buena Vista Social Club, Guster, Los Lobos, and more.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.",Americana,Indie Rock,"Charlottesville, VA",http://audio.sxsw.com/2019/mp3_by_artist_id/03e1e204a1cabfec1992a093eb1c5a6e9463c72e3bcbe4d44b72d3023dfd5afd.mp3,David Wax Museum at Aviator Nation,"Mar 16, 2019",5:00pm-5:40pm,Aviator Nation

387,Dead Meadow,"Dead Meadow formed in 1998 from the remnants of two young indie DC bands, The Impossible Five ""Gern Blandsten Records"" and its immediate follow-up Colour. The band started as Jason Simon on vocals and guitar, Steve Kille on bass, and Mark Laughlin on drums. They began to combine 70s heavy metal and 60s psychedelic rock with themes from authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien and H. P. Lovecraft. The first album, Dead Meadow, was released in 2000 on Tolotta Records, a label run by Fugazi bassist Joe Lally. The LP version was released by Planaria Records. This was quickly followed by 2001's Howls from the Hills, also released on Tolotta Records. At the completion of ""Howls from the Hills"" John Peel asked Dead Meadow to record a Peel Session which was recorded in Fugazi's home studio, the first time a Peel Session was recorded outside the BBC studios.
In Spring 2002, Laughlin parted ways with the band in order to pursue a career as a lawyer. He was replaced by long-time friend Stephen McCarty (previously with Canyon, also of Gern Blandsten). A live album, Got Live If You Want It, was released in mid-2002, which documented one of the last shows with drummer Mark and was produced by Anton Ne

388,Dead Soft,"Hailing from Vancouver BC, Dead Soft is a four-piece band pairing playful, melody-driven rock ‘n roll with high energy power-pop anthems. Or, as the band describes it: “Dead Soft is grunge-punk for the people.” Their most recent EP, New Emotion, features five catchy, earnest fuzzed-out rock songs that act as an empowering reminder that you are in control of your life, even when life feels out of control.
After a string of singles, Dead Soft released their self-titled debut in 2014 on Kingfisher Bluez and JEFF the Brotherhood’s Infinity Cat Recordings. The band spent the next four years on the road, including support tours with Bully and The Dirty Nil. 
Their new EP, released by Canadian indie label Arts & Crafts, is focused on the themes of loss/renewal and new beginnings which aligns closely with changes in the band. Specifically, the recent additions of Alex Smith (drums) and Kyle Schick (guitar) have allowed for a bigger sound, more hooky guitar leads, and more Beach Boys-like harmonies.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.",Rock,Grunge,"Vancouver, BC, CANADA",,Dead Soft at Bungalow,"Mar 14, 2019",9:00pm-9:45pm,Bungalow
389,Deaf Poets,"Deaf Poets are an American garage/alternative rock duo consisting of Sean Wouters (Lead Vocals/Guitar) and Nico Espinosa (Vocals/Percussion), born in Miami Beach, FL and currently residing in Brooklyn, NY. Their music is unabashedly raw, raucous, and loud, raging through the wild buzz and hiss of Wouter’s distorted guitars and the fever-pitch hits and pulsating momentum of Espinosa’s drums. Their boyhood rock and roll idols, from Jimmy Page to Kurt Cobain, eventually became their influences as they combined elements of ‘70s rock and a shot of ‘90s grunge to define their sound.

390,Dean Lewis,"On Dean Lewis’s hit single “Be Alright” for Island Records, he perfectly captures gut-wrenching heartbreak that comes with the hardships of a break-up. But while it deals candidly with anguish, the chorus swells with hope; a recognition that this pain is only temporary, with Lewis emotively singing “It’s never easy to walk away/ Let her go/ it’ll be ok”. “Be Alright” has already amassed over 200million streams and is the first taste of Lewis’ forthcoming album and signals a newfound conviction in his own storytelling and singing capabilities. Lewis’ debut EP Same Kind Of Different,  gave us chart-topping single, “Waves,” which was added to Triple J rotation, has had over 122 million streams, 31 million video views and was the second biggest Australian single of 2017.  Suddenly, Lewis was gracing the stages of Europe’s biggest television shows, playing headline shows and festivals slots across Australia and the US. “Waves” even appeared on programs like Suits, Riverdale and Grey’s Anatomy.

state tour. 
Her sound mixes the classic country sounds of Reba, McBride and the smoky voice of Stevie Nicks with a modern country/pop freshness that energizes the senses in today's crazy lightning-paced world. Her brash lyrics come straight from her sleeve, weaving stories of heartache, hard-living & hopeless romanticism. She was paralyzed now on the mend she's at it again! 
There is no missing this sonic sultress when she crosses your path. Lord knows she fought like hell to get here so damnit you better pay attention.

392,Dear Boy,"Dear Boy had an immense 2018. They were hailed as one of the best bands in LA by critics and music publications, sold out multiple hometown shows, embarked on a full US tour w/ Rogue Wave, while also playing dates w/ Day Wave and Sunflower Bean. They're starting 2019 running full blast with ""Semester,"" the first new single from The Strawberry EP, released on 3/1 via the band's own label Easy Hell and Burnside/The Orchard. The song, is best described by vocalist and guitarist Ben Grey; ""Most of us have whole periods of our lives that are defined by one person… And when that person leaves, returning to your normal life feels strange. Almost as if the world moved on behind your back.""
The band has inspired the respect of fellow artists, so it should come as no surprise that The Strawberry EP features appearances by their friends Day Wave, Hazel English and Patrick Spurgeon of Rogue Wave. Produced by Dear Boy, and mixed by Tony Hoffer (AIR, Phoenix, Beck, M83), the EP once showcases their ability to craft bittersweet songs pulling from late 70's / early 80's Post-Punk and early 90's Britpop, large enough for arenas, but intimate enough to be with you during your most private moments.

394,DEATHCHANT,"
DEATHCHANT is the brainchild of TJ Lemieux (CHILD, Psychedelic speed freaks, Mainline ladies, Babylon) formed in 2018 in Los Angeles, CA. They have been dubbed Psychedelic rock, proto-metal, doom, stoner metal, noise-punk, hard rock, and everything in between, but if you ask them it's ""rock and roll with psychedelic influences."" Their imagery and sound seem to fluctuate rapidly between a peaceful meditative eastern-tinged message of unity and all out warcry with an underlying message of love and peace-through-violence. 
Driven by Thomas (TJ) Lemieux’s brooding aesthetic and signature psychedelic guitar character, DEATHCHANT echoes through the darker side of Proto-metal and hard rock. Reflections of past endeavors from TJ Lemieux, John Bolino, Colin Fahrner, and George Camacho (Roast, psychedelic speed freaks, high rise, Babylon) cascade into an immersive wall of noise-induced heavy metal mania, equal parts paranoia and transcendental harmony. These four create a sound that is loud, massive, and about as melodic as a sonic assault of this magnitude can be.  They resonate with wherever or whoever you are and deliver an excitingly raw and catchy brand of rock and roll.

He released his first two mixtapes during the mid-2000s. The year he graduated from LSU and began teaching mathematics at a middle school, he released his third mixtape. In 2009, the same year he opted to stop teaching and focus on music, he self-released David & Goliath, his proper debut album, throughout which he maintained his down to earth underdog approach. Several additional mixtape releases followed, and his profile continually grew; 2012's The Focus Tape alone featured collaborations with Killer Mike, Mannie Fresh, and Juvenile. The year it was released, he made an appearance on HBO's Treme (season three, episode nine). Augustine signed to RCA Inspiration and released an EP, 3's Up, in 2015. ~ Andy KellmanProgramming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.",Hip-Hop / Rap,None,"New Orleans, LA",,Dee-1 at The Belmont,"Mar 13, 2019",11:10pm-11:30pm,The Belmont

398,Deeper,"Deeper’s Origins date back to 2014 when prior to releasing any material an abrupt line-up change left the Chicago based band looking for a new direction. Singer and guitarist Nic Gohl along with childhood friend, guitarist Mike Clawson and drummer Shiraz Bhatti threw out all of their old songs and brought on bassist Drew McBride to round out the lineup. The subsequent demos leaned on intricate guitar interplay, direct “of the times” vocals and a spirit that speaks to the band’s collective place in this pit of endless internet.
Deeper honed their sound over the course of 2015 and 16’ in basements, lofts, and anywhere that would have them. Touring the demos and landing at a fully realized inflection point. Call it Post-Punk, call it Indie Rock, it’s a record that steps in and out of boxes filtered through an unmistakable midwestern lens.

399,A Deer A Horse,"Rooted in Brooklyn’s DIY scene and inspired by the chaos of New York City, A Deer A Horse has grown into a relentless touring act over the years, clocking in over 200 shows across the country, and garnering a nod by Audiofemme as one of the hardest working touring bands in the US.
Formed by college classmates Rebecca Satellite (vocals/guitar) and Angela Phillips (bass/vocals), the band came into its own with the addition of drummer Dylan Teggart, as the thundering rhythm section began to channel the weight of their lyrical content.
Their 2017 EP, Backswimmer, drew praise from the AV Club, which compared the unlikely marriage of doom metal dirges with vocal earworms to “the Melvins turning in a pop song, finding ways to keep a hook running through a song that’s otherwise grim and sludgy.”
In 2018, A Deer A Horse released singles ""Cold Shoulder"" and ""Double Wide"", recorded at Silver Cord Studio, home-base of French metal pioneers, Gojira. The band is showing no signs of letting up their heavy touring schedule, and are in post-production on their as-yet-unannounced album.

Deerhunter’s eighth LP forgets the questions and makes up unrelated answers. It gets up, walks around, it records itself in several strategic geographic points across North America. It comes home, restructures itself and goes back to bed to avoid the bad news.
From the opening harpsichord and piano figures of ‘Death in Midsummer’, it is impossible to tell where the record came from. Is ‘No One’s Sleeping’ an outtake of an aborted Kinks recording session in 1977 Berlin with Eno producing? No. That is nostalgia. If there is one thing Deerhunter are making clear it is that they have exhausted themselves with that toxic concept. 
Deerhunter are a band from Atlanta GA, comprised on Bradford Cox, Lockett Pundt, Moses Archuleta, and Josh McKay.

401,Deezie Brown,"Based out of Austin, Texas, Deezie Brown delivers a very edgy, dark, and rebellious depiction of Alternative Hip-Hop and Electronic Pop. Deezie Brown was exposed to hip-hop at an early age while he rode around with his dad listening to some of the great artists of the South such as OutKast and UGK.
His debut album, Judith, was released on February 26th, 2018. The album, which is named after Judith from The Bible, was a woman who fought her town as it was besieged by enemies and death imminent. She murdered the enemy general, Holofernes and hung his severed head on the city walls. 
The album is a reflection of this story. Deezie found his creative mind, heart and soul being challenged by various ‘enemies’. The album is the beheading of these enemies. A triumphant body of work. Judith stands as the beheaded enemies as Deezie is currently working on his sophomore project.
The album was received well among the underground landing him interviews on the ‘Kayne Podcast’, ‘The Most Unruly’ and continuous spins on KUTX 98.9. He played at the notable SXSW Festival, The Underground Music Showcase and Austin’s Inaugural Summer Jam.

402,Dehd,"Love is everyday magic. That’s the impression you get listening to Water, the new album by
Chicago trio Dehd. Veterans of Chicago’s increasingly fruitful DIY scene Jason Balla ( Ne-Hi
and Earring) Emily Kempf (Vail and formerly with Lala Lala) and drummer Eric McGrady share a
strange and inexplicable chemistry. The music is hazy and reverb-drenched, a scuzzy and hyped-up take on surf rock that could only come from the Third Coast. It’s all animated by the red-lining feel-good spirit of the Velvet Underground’s Loaded and the breezy melodicism of C86-era indie rock, with a dash of the Cramps’ spooky-hop bop courtesy of McGrady’s locomotive drumming. It’s a clear-eyed look at the wild nature of everyday life that’s been spun up in sugary sweet melodies and scratched-crystal sounds. More than anything, it’s the embodiment of Dehd’s m.o. from the start: As Kempf puts it, “Work with what you have and make it magical.”

Now, for over 20 years they have rocked us with their De La songs full of inscrutable samplings, whimsically irreverent lyrics, social commentary, light rhythm and laid back rhymes.

Aesthetically delicate, there is a deep soul connection at play when these two come together.  Thus far, the sisters have spent their careers individually making waves in different artistic spheres, and now are coming together for the first time creatively. 
While the two sisters have played music together for their entire lives, it is only now that they are officially banding together.  The upcoming self titled release, ""Delle Sorelle"" allows the listener a glimpse into the intimate world of their sisterhood.  Stripped down to the sound of their voices, a fiddle, and a ukulele, their music expresses the tenderness of a passing moment grounded through the rooted strength of their undeniable connection to one another and the audience.  
“We’ve been partners in crime since the beginning, making up songs in the comfort of our bedrooms...but there comes a time when sisters need to stand together and show the world how easy it is to love one another.”  - Stephanie Hunt

His empowering messages and passionate delivery are consistently relatable as they tackle everyday struggles, faith and triumph. “I always want people to be able to feel encouraged that they are not the only ones that may be dealing with the internal dialogue about life struggles,” he says. “I want people to feel like my story is their story.” Deraj’s personal style and artwork compliment his music, driven by his background as a graphic designer.

413,Destiny Rogers,"19-year-old Destiny Rogers is a singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist who was born and bred in Lodi, a small Northern California town. At age 6, she became obsessed with skateboarding and even thought she wanted to pursue her passion professionally. But, growing up in the church with her father who is a youth pastor and listened to AC/DC and Mexican mother who listened to Miriachi, Destiny was pulled in by the power of music. At age 9 she received her first guitar and by age 10 taught herself how to play by watching Justin Bieber covers online and thereafter realized she could sing.
After a few years of busking in Los Angeles on the weekends and facing trials and tribulations of the music industry, she was finally connected to members of Grammy-Award winning songwriter/producer team The Stereotypes (Bruno Mars, Cardi B) and eventually began working with them. She signed to their label, Beach Wave Sound in 2018.  The result is confidence in the languid R&B and hip-hop-inflected pop songs which can be heard on her upcoming EP.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.",Pop,R & B,"Lodi, CA",,Destiny Rogers at The Belmont,"Mar 14, 2019",9:00pm-9:10pm,The Belmont

415,Devon Church,"It can take years to find your voice. In the case of the Winnipeg-born, Brooklyn-based musician Devon Church, it took the dissolution of a decade-long marriage and creative collaboration (Exitmusic, a nightmare-pop project co-founded by Church's ex-wife) to send him down the road of discovering his own singular, rough-hewn-yet-elegant style. 
Church applies his experience as a producer, multi-instrumentalist and songwriter to an equally absorbing solo project—one that plunges his Cohen-esque pop poetics into an ocean of drone, psychedelic minimalism, harmonic noise, and distortion-tinged, angelic ambience. Sensuous, surrealist lyrics—touching on themes of romantic obsession, religious ambivalence, dysfunctional families, and the ineffable strangeness of human existence—are delivered in a ravaged, soulful baritone, approximating some chimeric offspring of two-cigarettes-at-once Tom Waits, a tripped-out David Bowie, and John Maus.  The result is a well-crafted exploration of samsara and nirvana, heaven and earth, two states seemingly coexisting in the songs themselves. It's an entrancing listen.

Dice Soho first burst onto the national scene with music video “Just Watch,” a collaboration with longtime friend Trill Sammy. Although Dice was barely a 20-year-old, the video established several hallmarks of his future style: a cinematic sound, a dynamic voice, an outrageous sense of fashion—in other words, pure energy. 
The video became widely popular, with over 15 million views, but the young artist, born in June of 1995, had been active in Houston’s underground scene since 2004. His uncle, local Rapper SMOOV, had introduced Dice to the wild lifestyle that would become his calling. As a teenager, Dice (he added “Soho” later, as a homage to his birthplace in South Houston), founded Icey Life, a collection of artists and singers. His energy uniquely carries his live performances, and he has opened for many national and regional artists. In the footsteps of his city’s originators in Pimp C & Paul Wall—who combined music with distinct attitude and fashion—Dice Soho is defining what it means to be a Houston artist in rap’s new era.

Diego has always transcended Flamenco in his music. Not only a singer but also a prolific musical producer, arranger, composer and guitarist, Diego is one of the top references in the world when it comes to the fusion of Flamenco with other genres.
The unusual story of this Andalusian native began with his studies in the conservatories of Seville, Granada and Cordoba. By day he worked on majoring in Composition and Orchestral Music, and by night, he immersed himself in the oral tradition of Flamenco, gathered around a fire with a guitar coupled with the characteristic sounds of the Palmas and Flamenco singing. This duality marked the birth of his daring proposal to bring Flamenco closer to other musical styles.
His debut album, ""Vengo Caminando"", is an eclectic work rooted in Flamenco, yet tastefully opens doors into other styles of music. Nominated by prestigious Latin Grammy Awards in the category of ""Best Flamenco Album"". After 60 concerts in Spain in the last 12 months, he is now preparing his first US tour.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.Artist is seeking the following professional connections: Distribution - US",World,Flamenco,"Madrid, SPAIN",,Diego Guerrero at Maggie Mae’s Gibson Room,"Mar 14, 2019",9:00pm-9:40pm,Maggie Mae’s Gibson Room

Having cemented a place as a permanent fixture in the global musical landscape, it was Dillon’s early life which proved the deepest footprint in his musical journey.
Born and raised in Crown Heights to West Indian parents, Cooper's passion started at an early age, playing the piano as a child before picking up the guitar at the tender age of seven. Further inspired by the reggae sounds of his Grandfather involved in Bob Marley’s early movement, Cooper honed his instrumental skills through his youth.
Dillon’s talent soon led to a place at the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston – home to such musical luminaries as super producer Quincy Jones. However, it was just a few semesters after enrolling that Cooper knew he had to quit, with his decision enforced by a chance conversation with John Mayer, who advised him to leave. Dillon took Mayer’s word for it and he hasn’t looked back since.
Although his earliest forays into rap had been “just for fun” he knew he had to take his gift to the next level

425,The Dirty Nil,"Sure, playing 350 shows over the past three years all over the world was pretty impressive, but The Dirty Nil didn’t just spend the past few years on the road in support of their debut album, Higher Power. They spent much of it opening for—and, more importantly, studying—the greats: Against Me!, Billy Talent, Alexisonfire. They’re bands who, like the Nil, cut their teeth for years on the local circuit, but now find themselves playing arenas and headlining festivals. With Master Volume, The Dirty Nil are ready to make the same leap—not by polishing their sound for radio, but by bulking it up to fill the stadiums and open fields of their most vivid rock ‘n’ roll fantasies. 
Produced by John Goodmanson, Master Volume is an album that crunches and grooves where the band once smashed and trashed, unleashing the Nil’s undiminished raw power in more controlled waves to better target the back rows. “It’s less of a sprint and more of a strut,” singer Luke Bentham says. Loaded with steady-grooving songs about living fast and life-affirming anthems about dying young, Master Volume ultimately amplifies The Dirty Nil’s most essential quality: their refusal to be defined.

427,Divino Niño,"Listening to Divino Niño feels like catching up with an old friend. There’s undeniable songwriting chemistry between guitarist Camilo Medina and bassist Javier Forero, who met as kids in Bogotá, Colombia and years later reconnected by sheer happenstance after their families had both moved to Miami. Now Chicagoans, their rhythmic, soulful --and at times bilingual --Latinx punk songs are a reflection of their continent-spanning bond and proof that Divino Niño couldn’t have formed without unlikely but happy coincidences.
After cutting their teeth in southern Florida bands, Forero and Medina decamped to Chicago in 2010 to study at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. There they met guitarist Guillermo Rodriguez and together, the three became roommates in 2013 and started recording the earliest Divino Niño demos. Drummer Pierce Codina caught wind of these demos and joined shortly after.
Divino Niño's new single ""Foam"" was released January 29th via Winspear. The band's new LP will follow in the summer of 2019.

I have been in the music industry for quite some time now and when I say I have tried it all, I really have. I was promoter, hype man and also owned an entertainment company etc.  After all the trying to find my path in the music industry, I had a friend who was a DJ, I will go to his gigs sometimes and I am always just amazed with what he can do with his controller. One day I decided to buy a controller and from there, the rest is history.

Too soon, however, Jam Master Jay was taken from the world due to a fatal shooting in 2002, & the world, along with the Mizell family, endured the tragic loss of a legend.  Three years later, Jason Mizell Junior made the decision to follow in his father’s footsteps & has since created a buzz within the entertainment industry as one of the most promising new figures in the industry.  For the art of DJing, Jason Mizell Jr. has the strength of mind, raw talent, and dedication that can contribute towards the ever-changing sound of music.

461,DJ Paypal,"DJ Paypal is one of footwork’s most fascinating figures. His playful moniker and internet-savvy branding hint at a healthy sense of humour, but his music is as lush and soulful as his fellow Teklife producers. As the leader of Mall Music Inc, the label home to peers like DJ Orange Julius and DJ Mastercard, he’s outlined a new take on footwork laden with lush synthesizers and hi-definition sonics, while his work on LuckyMe has pointed towards an interest in soul and disco.
All of these factors come into play for Sold Out, his debut for Brainfeeder and a record that takes him beyond the pale of footwork into something all his own. Sold Out is a showcase for everything Paypal can do at 160 BPM, and it taps into the deep lineage of soul, hip-hop and jazz that defines the Brainfeeder discography.
Since 2013, Paypal has toured clubs throughout the world, from Europe to Asia to America, and played several key events and festivals such as MoMA PS1, Low End Theory, Roskilde Festival, and Dour Festival. Live, Paypal is a psychedelic high octane club workout plan. His take on Juke and Footwork is kaleidoscopic and vivid, expanding on the Teklife template for a sound that looks backwards and

The self-proclaimed “Barrio God” grew up listening to soul music and classic Motown like The Temptations, Sunny Ozuna, and Sam Cooke because of his parents, and his rap style is heavily influenced by ‘90s rap greats Tupac, Will Smith, and Big Pun. Socially, Doe looks up to people like Cesar Chavez and Malcolm X. Doeman’s influences are displayed through his musical choices in terms of his lyricism, cadence, and musicality.

Having signed her deal with Harvest Records in early 2018, Missal has also recently appeared as a featured artist on Macklemore’s GEMINI, written songs for the Netflix original series The Get Down, and supported K.Flay at a pair of sold-out shows. “This isn’t a record about love and loss and relationships,” Missal says. “It’s about taking chances for yourself, figuring out who you are and really standing behind that.

DOSSEY is the electro-pop alter-ego of the enigmatic Sarah Dossey, who derives her sound from a truly eclectic appreciation of music and art. The banjo playing member of Austin-based folk/bluegrass trio Indian & the Jones, DOSSEY’s sound as a solo artist is very much influenced by traditional American folk, all through the funnel of 1980s synth pop and new wave. A songwriter at heart, her music is always built on a foundation of a catchy, memorable hook, paired with a danceable beat.
2019 has already been a landmark year for DOSSEY, featured on NPR's All Songs Considered ""Austin 100"" as one of 100 artists to see at SXSW this year, as well of one of ""15 Must-See Austin Artists SXSW Music 2019"" by The Austinot. Her two single releases in 2018 received premiers (in addition to some glowing reviews) with Earmilk (Heartbeats) and Ladygunn (Plastic Diamonds).

Yet to say Dua, who identifies as gender non-binary and goes by they/them pronouns, has arrived fully-formed on their first ever EP project titled Nūr (pronounced “noor” - meaning “the light” in Arabic). They may have just decided to try songwriting, but they’ve spent their life working across divisions: borders, mediums, identities, and protest lines. 
It is Dua Saleh’s fluidity of sound and form that makes them so enlivening. Their vocal range is elastic, floating from an elegant purr into an unvarnished, guttural growl, and then back again at a moment’s notice. Their writing can be dreamy, but more often plumbs the soul, pricking deep with a poet’s precision and showing the scars that remain. To listen to Dua Saleh is to hear, in real time, someone fight for the right to define themselves for themselves.

514,Duncan Fellows,"On a sweltering, quiet corner of Duncan Ln. in Austin, TX stood a one-story house with 14 inhabitants. During the summer of 2012, the house's AC failed and a careless landlord refused to repair the fan. It was here that Colin Harman and Cullen Trevino first met and began to write songs, thus forming Duncan Fellows.
After independently releasing Twelve Months Older (2013) and Marrow (2015), the Fellows hit the road with Houndmouth, and then Joseph. Eager to release new music, DF hit the studio in early 2017 to record their debut LP Both Sides of the Ceiling.
With the release of Both Sides of the Ceiling (August 2017), a fresh upbeat sound catapulted them to the forefront of the Austin music scene. Their newfound sound has seen airplay on hometown favorite KUTX and Spotify’s Feel Good Indie Rock playlist. Fan favorite and lead single ""Fresh Squeezed"" garnering over a million plays on streaming platforms. 
Through their charismatic stage presence and high energy sets, DF attracted crowds to sold out shows in the fall with Middle Kids leading up to their massive debut at Austin City Limits. Riding off of the success of 2018, DF plans to tour and release new music in 2019.

516,The Dunts,"Storming the Glaswegian scene and beyond, The Dunts are quickly becoming one of Scotland’s hottest exports. Forming in late 2016, the young quartet are demanding attention with their unique ‘council punk’-branded sound.
Produced by Johnny Madden (of Baby Strange) and Chris Marshall (Gerry Cinnamon, Rascalton, The Van T’s), their debut self-released EP ‘Not Working Is Class’ boasted vicious yet intelligently energetic punk anthems, squeezed into an electrifying 9 minutes.
Stand-out track ‘Dimitri’, gained ardent radio support from, Radio X’s John Kennedy and BBC Radio 1’s Huw Stephens - who crowned the single ‘Pick Of The Week’. Follow-up track ‘Birds and The Beez’, and the recent release, ‘Witch Hunt’ also gained Stephens’ coveted accolade, and received plays on global tastemaker stations like Los Angeles’ KROQ and Germany’s FluxFM.
Their live performances have rewarded them with sold-out shows in hometown venues; their rocketing reputation taking them to festival stages at Electric Fields, and the monumental Reading and Leeds.
United by an undeniable ferocity and tongue-in-cheek sensibilities, The Dunts are Rab Smith, David McFarlane, Colin McGachy and Kyle McGhee.

Their music communicates with the contemporary as it eliminates the boundaries lying in the traditional music structure and instrument and embracing musical elements from other genres of music such as jazz and rock while preserving the intrinsic style and beauty of Korean folk simultaneously. Their professional debut was made after winning the first place (KB Sori Award) at the 2015 Jeonju Int’l Sori Festival. Since then, DUO BUD has been musically active worldwide, playing at the world renowned music festivals and theaters such as Babel Med Music in France, Golden Melody Awards, National Kaohsiung Center for the Arts and Pingtung Performing Arts Center in Taiwan, Okarina Festival in Slovenia, Ritmo Festival in Hungary and engage the world tour in Chicago, New York, Mexico and Cuba.

518,Durand Jones & The Indications,"Durand Jones & the Indications aren’t looking backwards. Helmed by foil vocalists in Durand Jones and drummer Aaron Frazer, the Indications conjure the dynamism of Jackie Wilson, Curtis Mayfield, AND the Impressions. Even with an aesthetic steeped in the golden, strings-infused dreaminess of early ‘70s soul, the Indications’ sophomore LP, American Love Call, is planted firmly in the present, with the urgency of this moment in time.
The Indications’ 2016 self-titled debut was the product of friends who met as students at Indiana University in Bloomington, In., recorded for $452.11, including a case of beer. American Love Call, the band’s sophomore LP is instead the record the Indications dreamed of making, fleshed out with strings, backing vocals, and a newfound confidence in songwriting.
Blending a slew of influences from years spent crate-digging, guitarist Blake Rhein says the Indications approach songs in the same way hip-hop producers do, as likely to pull inspiration from ‘70s folk-rock or classic R&B as they are Nas’ Illmatic.
“Did I expect to do this shit once I got out of college? Hell no,” Jones relays, laughing. “Totally not. But this is what God is telling me to do –

Dwagie has attracted various media coverages, from Hype Magazine, Hip Hop Dx, to MTV Iggy. In a closing summary of a feature article  wrote “There are MCs abroad that are closer to the hip-hop ideal than most American rappers. Dwagie is one of the brightest examples. American hip-hop can learn a lot from Dwagie — if it takes the time to listen.”
In 2014, Dwagie collaborated with DJ Premier and Nas and released 2 tracks “Classic” and “Refuse to Listen,” respectively.

520,Dwellers,"The Dwellers are on the threshold…again!
On the threshold of what, you may understandably inquire? World domination, the apocalypse, a slushy mission to the local 7-Eleven?
The answer may well be “all of the above,” but we think none is as important as the impending release of the Salt Lake City group’s hotly anticipated second full-length, Pagan Fruit (call us biased!), which is due to see the light of day through Small Stone Recordings in May of 2014.
The album follows in the still echoing sonic shockwaves of Dwellers’ enthusiastically received debut of 2012, Good Morning Harakiri, which saw the newly assembled trio of vocalist/guitarist Joey Toscano, bassist Dave Jones, and drummer Zach Hatsis pooling together their impressive prior musical credentials (Toscano with psych-metal adventurers Iota; Jones and Hatsis with doom/goth atmospheric bandits, SubRosa) with staggeringly powerful and memorable results.
Now, the terrible triplets are confident they can one-up themselves with Pagan Fruit: an album that both exceeds the lysergic power chord trip initiated on that first album, and expands the band’s creative horizons into realms heretofore unexplored.

Here is a band that seeks to join the dots between the optimistic gospel-rap of Chance The Rapper, the scattergun storytelling of Arctic Monkeys, and the velvety vibes of vintage Dilla (all through the lens of “rainy middle England”). Murray was raised and has worked all his life on the Leicesteshire farm run by his parents, learning from an early age the value of getting your hands dirty to get where you want to be. He is joined by bassist, saxophonist, singer and school friend Sam. Also in their ranks are drummer Cass, guitarist Louis and Jordan, on percussion, keys and backing vocals. What’s emerged is a manifesto to truly live by, and appears to be resonating with sold-out crowds. “Easy Life is a form of escapism,” says Murray. “Living is proving to be increasingly difficult with all the pressures that modern life brings, and easy life rejects this materialistic philosophy; easy life is a hedonistic vision. When we coined the name there was a lot less thinking involved, but it feels like we have embodied the name over time”.

Or about another bandmate deciding to go off on his own to find his “voice” and make a record that “matters”. Between the barrage of superlatives and unwarranted argument of how the debut album challenges any post-Beatles' solo work, folks just can’t help but doze off. Sure it could be the lack of sleep, self medicating or early onset dementia, but let’s be honest. We lack bandwidth for all the quality material thrown at us today. Oh we try to keep up, but how can we? I mean there’s 9 ‘Real Housewives’ reality shows concurrently running and American Idol just got picked up for season 17. And those priorities WILL NOT be compromised. So where does that leave us? If what you’ve read thus far hasn’t done it, just look at the pic over there. Doesn’t it make you wonder what those baby blues are stoically reading about? The weather, sports, a Grammy nod!? Nah, it’s probably just the demise of civilization as we know it crumbling into a sea of apathy. But not to worry, Rome didn’t fall in a day. There’s still plenty of time to ignore impending doom and enjoy the finer things in life...like this artist!

Since leaving his day job as a footwear designer in 2018 he has been alternating between work on his own label g’LOSS, directing and editing visuals for artists like Bladee and Yves Tumor, and attending London and Paris fashion weeks as both runway model and jury member, while hard at work developing the next phase of his musical output under his stage name ECCO2K with studio sessions in Stockholm, Berlin, and Los Angeles.
The SXSW YEAR0001 showcase will be his first solo live performance in the US, following the more experimental direction of his previous sets on the main floors of Berlins Berghain and Kraftwerk.

534,Edie Brickell & New Bohemians,"Thirty years ago, Edie Brickell and New Bohemians exploded out of Dallas and became an international sensation with their double-platinum debut album, Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars, featuring Top Ten hit, “What I Am.” The follow-up, 1990’s Ghost of a Dog, came quickly, but the NewBos didn’t put out an album until Stranger Things in 2006. Now, the group returns with Rocket (2018, Verve Forecast), their first new music in a dozen years—and as the title indicates, they remain a propulsive and unclassifiable force, a whirlwind of musical ideas and styles.
The band members, of course, have all continued to create music and collaborate on other projects, but never lost touch. Every few years, Brickell would reconnect with guitarist Kenny Withrow, drummer Brandon Aly, bass player Brad Houser, and percussionist John Bush and they would improvise new songs. In 2017, when the band reunited for three sold-out benefit shows for La Rondalla arts school, their improvisational drive led to an album’s worth of new songs. Rocket bounces effortlessly between genres, from the disco strut of “Exaggerate” to the shimmering and propulsive “Superhero,” to the reggae lope of “Singing in the Shower.”

He studied instrumental and vocal Radif (the Persian musical repertory) with Parviz Meshkatian and Pashang Kamkar. In 2001 he became a Santoor teacher at the Center of Art and Culture in Isfahan and several music schools in Tehran. The traditional style of Santoor playing, however, did not satisfy Ehsan’s creative and searching soul. He was looking for expanding his techniques through learning a modern style of playing Santoor, so he took lessons from Ardavan Kamkar.

Her new album wraps all those occasionally opposing forces in Elaina’s signature ranch rock-and-roll to create a modern portrait of steely femininity that’s sad, funny, and ultimately, inspiring. Produced by Paul Cauthen and engineered by Jeff Saenz, the album was recorded at Modern Electric in Dallas. Backed by Paul’s studio ringers the Texas Gentlemen, Elaina’s moody soprano slides from breathy storytelling to golden-era country songbirding and back again, nuanced and captivating. Drawing on her early life rodeoing and raising horses, as well as years since then, after the music completely took over, Elaina wrote or co-wrote every track. The result is a layered collection that is both starkly personal and intensely relatable. “In the last few years, I’ve grown so much,” says Elaina. “I’m not that small town ranch girl anymore.” She pauses, then adds with a smirk, “I run with the boys.”

546,Elder Island,"There is magic in Elder Island’s music and perhaps a little witchcraft. Trying to pin the Bristol trio’s sound down is pointless because the usual pop rules don’t apply. Textures matter as much as melodies. Genres bend and blend. Electronics rub shoulders with odd instruments. Katy Sargent sings as though casting a spell.
The Omnitone Collection, Elder Island’s extraordinary debut album, boasts ten tracks that are rich tapestries of tiny moments in time, but also sweeping soundtracks riven with ambition. They are songs to lose yourself in, to be swept away by, to send shivers up your spine.
Formed six years ago as an experiment-come-university hobby, Elder Island are singer and cellist Katy, bassist and beats maker Luke Thornton and guitarist and synth wizard David Havard. None hail from Bristol, but the city was what brought them together and its genre-mashing scene was what inspired them to start Elder Island.
The trio of Four Tet fans started out with jam sessions at home, adding weird percussion to Luke’s loops and stitching field recordings in to their soundscapey songs.

Raybon will release the first single from Supertoys on March 29th.
“Eli Raybon has done everything in his skinny armed, neophyte power to return synth-infused pop to the collective consciousness. And if that objective at all seems like a long shot, outlets like Vice and Paste have already endorsed him as a maestro of the form.” - Erick Mertz, Bearded Magazine
“Raybon's distinctive retro aesthetic seems 100% genuine, which begs the question - why is this Post-Millennial channeling 80's-era John Hughes soundtrack pop?” - Mike Olinger, Paste Magazine

Born to Sudanese and Scottish parents and raised across seven countries, she is the descendent of a long line of progressive artists and academics dating back to the 1800s. She holds an MPhil in Philosophy, speaks four languages and is a graduate in Jazz from the Guildhall School. She is a complex character, impossible to pigeon-hole as she constantly redefines herself.
Key to the respect the industry shows for Eliza’s work is the fact that she manages to be both a serious grafter and a true fighter for that which she believes in. Her debut album Future is a body of work she has fought tooth and nail to complete. Set on the bedrock of Eliza’s early folk and grunge influences, it revels in “flavours of trip-hop, West-Coast surf sounds, 80’s chorus, 90’s movie soundtracks, and all-out pop” while still managing to sound like a focused, devastatingly precise and cohesive body of work.
Eliza has toured across the UK and Europe and is looking forward to playing her first shows in the US at SXSW.

No stranger to the music industry, Murcia cut his teeth as a songwriter-producer penning songs for a diverse list of mainstream artists including Celine Dion and Pitbull. With El Mañana, Murcia moves away from crafting mainstream pop to create an authentic sound channeling his diverse musical sensibilities through layered guitar textures reminiscent of seminal British shoegaze bands like My Bloody Valentine and Slowdive, while still stepping very much forward into modern psychedelia a la Tame Impala. The songs feel dreamy & evocative with hints of melancholy while still highly melodic, colorful and full of light. Lyrically, Murcia’s songs reflect the duality of being bicultural— he writes in Spanglish juxtaposing the magical realism of his ancestral land in Colombia with the feel of the California magic hour he inhabits.

Warm and piercing vocals float above a sound inspired by country and rock, fuzzy desert sounds and analog synthesizers with a minimalistic touch. Her 6 track EP ”We Gotta Talk” was released in spring 2017, produced by Victor Van Vugt (Nick Cave, PJ Harvey). ""Unfurling with a gentle jangle, the crisp, spring-fresh songwriting can't fail to get under your skin” wrote Clash Magazine.

567,Emme,"Formed in 2016 after years of friendship, late night music nerd-out sessions, and pounds upon pounds of pizza, Emme is the indie-electro project of Sowmya Somanath and Walter Nichols. Having come up in both eastern and western classical music traditions, Somanath and Nichols let these distinct backgrounds inform their writing choices, resulting in a unique take on a pop duo.
Symmetry is a constant source of inspiration for Emme. The name is a wink to mathematician and physicist Emmy Noether, whose eponymous 1915 theorem brought natural symmetries and mathematics together in a way no one had yet to do.
Experiencing Emme live can feel like standing inside a gemstone. Reflections flutter, refractions bounce, and transformations weave about in the form of Somanath’s lush vocals and Nichols’s eclectic mix of saxophone, synthesizers, and effects. The resulting songs question pop conventions; they both challenge and reward.

568,Empath,"""Empath goes far beyond the sound of birds faintly chirping. They’re a band that writes songs like communing with nature, bringing all their fuzzed and tripped out idiosyncrasies into harmony. Empath began in 2016 when Garrett Koloski, Jem Shanahan, and Catherine Elicson moved into a house in West Philadelphia together, with Randall Coon joining shortly after. Even with the simple vision to shred, there’s a natural sensitivity in the way Empath communicates. Between the contrast of Elicson’s lush, almost delicate vocals, Koloski’s boisterous drumming, and the half-harmonious wash of guitar and Shanahan and Coon’s synths, Empath equips us with a healthy dose of emotional repose.""

573,Erin Rae,"Gifted with a unique ability to fuse musical genres and influences to craft songs that feel fresh and wholly her own, with her new album Putting On Airs (2018, Single Lock Records), Erin Rae has thrown down a direct challenge to the stereotype of what a Southern singer should be. Both lyrically and sonically, she strikes a fiercely independent chord, proudly releasing a deeply personal record that reflects her own upbringing in Tennessee, including the prejudices and injustices that she witnessed as a child that continue to impact her life to this day. According to Rae, ""this album was born out of a need to do some healing work in my personal life, in order to address some fears and patterns of mine to allow my true feelings to come to the surface."" 
Recorded in the dead of winter in an old Franciscan monastery on Wisconsin’s Fox River, the isolated environment created the perfect setting for Rae and her bandmates to track these genre-busting songs, using the chapel and other unique spaces within the cavernous building to explore new sonic boundaries, all while continuing to showcase the hypnotic vocals and song-serving restraint that have become her trademark.

“eX-Girl are a beautiful example of information overload. Jagged 3 part vocal harmonies, adventurous arrangements, and songs that hook you like the sucker that you are.” – Mike Patton 
Formed in Japan late 1997 despite any previous musical experience, despite this they would release their first album, “Heppoco Pou”, which was produced by Hoppy Kamiyama (touted as the Japanese Eno and now long time colaborator) in Japan back in June 1998. The album was instantly embraced by San Francisco college radio station KUSF where it went into heavy rotation. Tours across the world and internationally released records ensued, Compelling and captivating, eX-Girl can easily be ranked along side musical innovators such as Zappa, B-52’s, Nina Hagen, Devo, and Talking Heads. On stage the band incorporate performance-art aesthetics with wild costumes and intense energy. Enormous rubber wigs, frog-head masks and custom designed flower-power dresses, the band is instantly captivating. They give the audience the feeling they are observing something quite other worldly. And as far as the band is concerned, they are!

Soon, they found themselves performing in Amsterdam and Germany and releasing singles such as the 2017 “Bounce It,” which clocked 231K Spotify streams. Along the way, they fashioned the “Trap-n-B” sound that comes to life on the 2019 single “Here.” Backed by shimmering piano keys, the sparse production clears out space for the boys to seriously flex vocally. With show-stopping range, they flip from high falsetto into the hypnotic hook, “You should be here.” “We were all vibing together on that one,” B-Smoove recalls. “Everybody has thoughts and regrets in the past, but we always push forward. It comes from a heartfelt place of nothing but affection. You’re reminding your girl to remember how you were together and letting her know you’re not going to mess it up. It’s the beginning. We’re getting ready to give the world a lot of songs.”

Fangclub took a D.I.Y. approach to their burgeoning career by packing themselves off to a house in a coastal village in Kerry to record over 25 tracks. While on one of their first DIY tours, with the band still sleeping in their van, they came to the attention of Universal Music's Irish team. Suitably impressed that Fangclub had already recorded two EPs, not to mention their debut album, Universal signed the band in March 2015. Largely comprising songs from their original D.I.Y. efforts, their second EP, “Coma Happy”, appeared in 2016. Fangclub made their U.K. live debut in 2016 with Welsh group Pretty Vicious, and toured with Twin Atlantic. The album was released in 2017 with Vertigo & Virgin EMI Records to glowing reviews with the band themselves calling it “A love letter to our favourite bands"". The self-titled album was chock-full of raw yet melodic tracks that took their cue from the loud/quiet aesthetic of Pixies. It charted at no.5 and received a nomination for Choice Prize Album Of The Year.

hit the road to work with audio whiz Drew Vandenberg at the famed Chase Park Transduction in
Athens, GA. They ate together, smelled each other and broke down the ego achieving an
instinctive sound that allows expert musicianship and simple, evocative lyrics to work as one
highlighting the duality of space and constraint.
This record finds the sweet spot. It is angular and arresting, it is fast, it is repetitive, it is
kosmische, it is punk. It drones, it loops and swirls around. It is guitar rock for people who
wonder what it would be like if Ron Asheton and Michael Rother were also in Crazy Horse. The

Several major label overtures have been entertained down the years, but ultimately Bettinson has always preferred to pursue her own artistic vision.
“I like my pop music a little bit weird,” she says. “I like it to challenge, to push the envelope a little bit — not just repeat what’s gone before.” This has been the case ever since those early performances, which earned Bettinson the attention of Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, who recruited her to front electronic alt-pop group Ultraísta. Following rave reviews from Pitchfork, The Guardian and Rolling Stone, Bettinson then took a sabbatical to launch her solo career as FEMME.

After moving to New York in 2014 to study music production, Noah Champ (singer/drums) has since been joined by a rotating cast of live band members including Claire Gilb, Will Sacks, and Skyler Young. Three years of recording both at home and in the studio, and performing alongside acts such as Cloud Nothings, Homeshake, and Sunflower Bean find field trip tapping into further reaching sounds, connecting the dots between the likes of Factory Records alums, early trip hop, and space-age California.

611,Flint Eastwood,"Jax Anderson (aka Flint Eastwood) is a gay alt-pop artist from Detroit, Michigan who has has built an international audience by writing great songs and touring with the tireless work ethic that her city is famous for. She is known for her unapologetic fierceness on stage as much as her kindness and empathy. This approach has led to two top ten singles at indie radio in Australia over the last 12 months, with her latest peaking at #1 and a third song in rotation now. 
Paper Magazine said her latest release “This Is A Coping Mechanism For A Broken Heart” is as raw as it is expansive: “a modern pop menagerie that’s harder than ever to pin down [...] atmospheric synth-pop inflected with R&B and hip-hop notes. There’s Lana in her sorrow and syrupy delivery, Charli in her shimmering hooks, Florence in her folkiness, Sia in her jitters, and HAIM in her breathiness.” It’s a diversity of sonic influences tied together by an powerful commitment to vulnerable songwriting.
Jax comes to SXSW fresh off an Australian headlining tour, and in preparation for the release of her debut full length album later this year.

613,Flora Cash,"The husband-and-wife duo has seen major success with current single “You’re Somebody Else,” which has racked up 50m+ combined streams and was one of last year’s most Shazamed Alternative records. Forbes called it “brilliant,” saying it “is arguably the most intriguing song on radio this past year.” Flora Cash emerged when Minneapolis-native Cole Randall uploaded his music to SoundCloud and caught the attention of Sweden-based Shpresa Lleshaj, who stumbled upon his account and started leaving comments under the songs. Facebook messages gave way to an introductory phone conversation, which snowballed into marathon Skype sessions and eventually led to their marriage. The mystique of the music offset the exuberance of the union between them, and the duo stitched together a singular style from threads of personal anxiety, struggle and ultimately triumph.

614,Florry,"Florry is a brand new rock band from Philadelphia. Teenage bandleader Francie Medosch leads her rollicking ensemble (featuring Peter Gill, Theo Woodward, RL Srinivasan and Abbie Jones Hornburg) through the exuberant, yearning roller coaster tracks of Brown Bunny. There is a directness to Medosch’s lyricism and playfulness to her song’s arrangements that feels anxious and hopeful. When Medosch says “my fingertips are glowing / but it's not enough to keep me from blowing up,” on “ “Please,” one might believe her. Named in honor of Chloe Sevigny’s character in the film Brown Bunny, Medosch’s songs are about cultivating a sense of self-acceptance in the face of social shame and bullying. Brown Bunny is full of startling nuance and diverse emotionality, from the sorrowful melancholy of “KFG” to the anticipatory excitement of “Kanagawa”. Brown Bunny is a fully realized portrait of tying the loose ends of adolescence and venturing onwards.

Foie Gras is unabashedly loud and mystic, gentle and soft. Guitar driven, she lives at the intersections of secure drone and reimagined Americana, as if Brian Eno and Patsy Cline have committed themselves to an endless and passionate love aﬀair. Wake up, this is where your daughters have wandered oﬀ to.

Scotty May (Bass) grew up outside Detroit; Jacob Miguel (vocals) and Chris Goranson (guitar) outside Chicago. There's a grit, an authenticity, an anxious tension in the rock music from the rust belt. Take a group of guys who spent 30 years of 6-month winters cultivating their musical tastes and then drop them in Austin, TX, and you get FOOLS. Now joined forces with Zach Whitchurch (drums) Texas native. 
With one release to date - they have managed to open for significant local and touring acts such as Meat Wave, Dasher, Wildlife, Sweet Spirit, Think No Think, A.J. Davila, the MVP’s, Gym Shorts and Night Beats. These fire starters fill rooms quickly, bringing in onlookers from the street who are wondering, “Who the hell is that band?” A reputation for rowdy, energetic live shows has them lighting up faces of even the most out of place spectators.
FOOLS has undoubtedly left a mark on the underground scene in Austin, raising the stakes on how they are received by the rest of the world at SXSW 2019.

Using absurd lyrical imagery steeped in hallucinations, paranoia, and lust - the band’s strikes into dark, yet playful territory.

Despite being a baseless, it shows a wide range of musical songs full of playfulness that is not caught by a genre and thick sound that does not feel it.
Two members acted as the main vocal, and the singing voice of the nostalgic atmosphere of Gt & Vo. Takada,
Dr & Vo. Hasty cute singing voice of Kasai combined The other harmony with its unique charm is a weapon.
Some songs use instruments such as synthesizers, and some songs show off lap.

Starting at the festival, SUMMER SONIC, which shows the biggest excitement in Japan in 2017, it is getting more and more momentum.

638,Future Museums,"Founded in 2012, Neil Lord has an impressive catalog of wide ranging solo and collaborative albums under the moniker Future Museums. Lord recorded Rosewater Ceremony Part II by himself in 2017 immediately following Rosewater Ceremony using the same set of gear in his home studio. On this round of inner explorations and mental projections, Lord expands his emotional palette beyond the ubiquitous bliss of the first Rosewater Ceremony to include a dimension of empathetic consciousness. Gently pulsing percussion and bass sequences materialize into tastefully reserved rhythm sections, guiding Lord’s solemn guitar leads through the vast swells of atmospheric strings and shimmering trails of cosmic dust. Future Museums plunges deep into electronics for the Rosewater sessions, embracing drum machine, sampler and analog synthesizer as the primary voice. Future Museums has always forged a uniquely trance-inducing realm of sound manipulation out of a remarkable mix of intuition and technique, and now Lord has expanded his vocabulary both emotionally and tonally while continuing to preserve his essential center.

639,fuvk,"""Fuvk, who has been quietly releasing a small library of music over the last couple of years, uses songwriting as a cathartic release. Each song is a personal, vulnerable journal entry, chronicling day to day feelings about a variety of subjects. Everything is cool, quiet clarity that would be perfect for a long ride through snowy country, or a glass of wine by the evening fire. There is a reverent power in the delivery of every line, that demands the listener confront their own fears and hopes in the same way.""

640,Gabriella Cohen,"In the summer of 2017, Gabriella Cohen moved to a farm in countryside Victoria, Australia, to record and self-produce her second album with engineer and partner-in-crime, Kate ‘Babyshakes’ Dillon. There, amidst flocks of screeching white cockatoos and herds of Black Angus cows, they etched the beginning of Pink Is The Colour Of Unconditional Love. Armed with a microphone and an interface, Dillon and Cohen captured the final touches of the album on a boat in England, and the coast of Portugal; in the mountains of Southern Italy, cafes of Mexico, and finally in Venice Beach, CA.
Pink Is The Colour has materialised as an expansive and exciting body of work, showcasing Cohen’s unusually refreshing twists on pop arrangements. Throughout the new album Cohen (flanked by a choir of imaginary dolls that exist in her head) creates complex and sugary backing vocals. These signature vocal arrangements—contoured with classic harmonies and nostalgic melodies—form songs remarkable in their originality. 
It’s an epitaph of electric wonder, and a definitive fact: Pink is the Colour of Unconditional Love.

644,Gaelynn Lea,"When Gaelynn Lea won NPR Music’s 2016 Tiny Desk Contest, her two decades as a hardworking and talented musician finally crystallized in a beautiful moment of national recognition. It was also just the beginning of a grand adventure. With the wind of her award at their backs, Gaelynn and her husband Paul sold their house in Northern Minnesota, quit their jobs, bought a van, and hit the road.
Since then, Gaelynn has played over 425 shows in 43 states and seven countries, adding over 100,000 miles to their Ford Econoline’s odometer. Yet somehow between this perpetual blitz of performances, Gaelynn also managed to release her third full-length album in September 2018.
""Learning How To Stay"" is an 11-song collection that runs the gamut sonically from pensive and luscious to aggressive and intentioned, from folk to decidedly pop. Undoubtedly the connecting thread of this album is Gaelynn Lea herself. With her singular voice & deeply-affecting violin, she guides the listener through a journey that explores the contrasting nature of existence: dark and light, birth and death, anger and forgiveness, sorrow and joy. ""Learning How to Stay"" encourages the listener to stay present for it all.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.Artist is seeking the following professional connections: Label, Management, Brand Partnership, Gear Endorsement, Distribution - US, Distribution - UK/Europe, Distribution - Worldwide, Other Artists to Tour With, Booking Agent - US, Booking Agent - UK/Europe, Booking Agent - Worldwide, PR/Publicity Agency, Producer/Studio Engineer, Publishing, Sync/Music Supervisors",Pop,Folk,"Duluth, MN",http://audio.sxsw.com/2019/mp3_by_artist_id/3949e798a28cdfebd26a0735c273c47177f7a84a25531ea5a019b4d14bb8da4e.mp3,Gaelynn Lea at The Hideout,"Mar 16, 2019",10:00pm-10:40pm,The Hideout
645,Gallops,"After releasing their debut album, a monstrous slab of dark experimental rock Yours Sincerely Dr. Hardcore in 2012 and at the peak of their sci-fi powers Wrexham’s Gallops soon announced they were no more and broke up in 2013. In 2016, almost three years to the day, they announced their return. After awaking from their nap, they have done so revitalised, rejuvenated and driven, creating an album that has stretched their horizons even further and is driven by the propulsive charge of electronic music. In January 2017 they announced the upcoming release of their second LP ‘Bronze Mystic’ on the Blood & Biscuits label. Release on April 21st 2017, the record matches the band member’s fuller sense of scope and vision; the sputtering electronics, and often-elongated guitar wails, recall the dystopian visions as depicted in the finest 1980s horror and sci-fi films. There are moments of soaring post-rock, humming dark ambience, esoteric offshoots, bubbling electronics and industrial-tinged noise. 2018 saw Gallops take their Live AV show on the road, with critically acclaimed performances at Roadburn Festival and Arctangent. They will release their third LP in 2019.

647,Garcia Peoples,"Discovering the secret and perhaps even endangered language of riffs, Danny Arakaki and Tom Malach formed Garcia Peoples in Rutherford, New Jersey, and over the past year and change, they've hit launching speed, writing albums’ worth of material too fast to release.  While 2018's ""Cosmic Cash"" and the upcoming ""Natural Facts"" (out March 29th on Beyond Beyond is Beyond) are the perfect introduction to the band’s cosmic Americana, the tapers have started showing up for Garcia Peoples, too, keeping track of the ever evolving live song suites. 
Playing cleanly articulated lines that perhaps recall some of great guitar tandems of yore–Allman/Betts, Jansch/Renbourn– while “summoning the Dead for Pavement fans”, Garcia Peoples epitomize ‘post-jam’ in its proper arrival point; borrowing all the best of what’s preceded them without regarding boundaries, a bounce all their own, and a characteristically delightful lack of polish to keep things grounded. With Andy Cush (bass), Cesar Arakaki (drums), and keyboardist Pat Gubler (PG6, Wet Tuna), it's a happy wonder to watch Garcia Peoples plunge into the outer reaches of rock with infectious enthusiasm.

650,G Child,"Gary “G Child” Denson was born and raised in Bessemer, Alabama. He developed a passion for music at the tender age of six while attending Macedonia Baptist Church, where he would later become the drummer and a lead vocalist. By the time he was 13, he was writing music and recording at local studios with high hopes of one day becoming famous.
By the end of 2005 his lifestyle had caught up with him causing him to lose five years of his freedom. His passion for music never left him. While incarcerated, it grew even stronger, as music was all he had in order to stay sane within the harsh confinement of the prison walls. Two years into his sentence, his mother had passed away from diabetes. This tragedy caused him to take his music to another level and he was determined to make good a promise he had made his mom years ago. 
After being released, he began to perform with a local band from Birmingham, Alabama singing cover songs in different venues throughout the city. Although this created a local buzz for him and set his performing foundation, G Child had much bigger aspirations. His focus shifted to diving deeper into his own creativity and developing original lyrics and sounds.

But the duo can be divided in more ways than just their physical existence, too, from geographical location and what they bring to the band, to their musical histories. 
It's the perfect mix of blissed out, beach-y pop - the aural equivalent of driving along the coast on a heavenly summer's day - and melancholy, heartbroken lyrics. Toma spearheads the musical side, while Star largely writes the lyrics, filling them with stories of her life. The title itself encapsulates that polarity, as well as the idea of Star's constant coming-and-going, flying across the great big blue of one ocean or another each time.

660,Ghostly Kisses,"Ghostly Kisses is the dreamy music of singer and songwriter Margaux Sauvé. She began to play the violin at the age of 5 following in the footsteps of her family of musicians. Years later, she started to sing and met Dragos Chiriac (Men I Trust). Together, they brought into being Ghostly Kisses first songs. The name 'Ghostly Kisses' was inspired from reading William Faulkner’s poem 'Une ballade des dames perdues’, and seemed a beautiful reflection of Margaux's ethereal voice. 
After releasing ""What You See - EP"" in 2017, her song 'Such Words' reached more than 50K listenings on Spotify 24 hours after its release and her song 'Roses' was chosen as the generic of cinematic film 'Ailleurs' in 2017. She also opened for international renowned artists such as RY X, Charlotte Cardin and Trixie Whitley in Canada and US.
With more than 7M plays on Spotify, she released 'The City Holds My Heart - EP' in 2018, a 5 pieces album inspired by the sonic textures of the 90's. Unfolding around Margaux’s soft voice, these songs progressively reveal different drums, synths, string arrangements and piano layers. Ghostly Kisses will release the sequel of this EP in 2019.

662,Gia Margaret,"Chicago singer/songwriter/producer Gia Margaret describes her music as “sleep rock.” It’s a genre all her own, combining elements of folk, shoegaze, slowcore, ambient electronica and trip hop. For her self-produced debut album, There’s Always Glimmer, Gia Margaret crafted twelve gorgeously melancholic lullabies to combat her own insomnia, and to salvage some beauty from the brighter and darker moments of her life.
There’s Always Glimmer explores relationships between friends, family members and significant others, often in past tense. Sparse verses isolate mundane moments of domestic and urban life, and choruses ache with earnest expressions of yearning and loss. The disarmingly simple language of Gia Margaret’s lyrics, when carried by the melodic sparkle of her singing voice, have the power to elevate an ordinary moment into something supremely nostalgic and sentimental. A ride on a train, a hand on a shoulder, a dog in a yard, the light of the moon through an apartment window are each made significant and sacred, worthy of examination and preservation.

Sabrina Ellis and Andrew Cashen’s lyrics, equal parts brutally honest, clever, and debased, have a knack for taking their idiosyncratic depravities and making them feel universal. These songs are by, for, and about the losers, freaks, and outcasts. The lonely. The terminally horny. Boozehounds and party animals. No band better speaks to the hearts of slackers, burnouts, rockers, sluts, and creeps everywhere than A Giant Dog.

664,Gina Chavez,"Being a Latinx Catholic lesbian means you learn how to hide...
“I wanted to make a record that captured the moment these two Catholic, Latinx lesbians got married in Texas,” said Chavez. “This EP is for all those who still feel they have to hide, and for those who wish we would stay in the closet.”
For her latest record, Gina Chavez -- a 10-time Austin Music Award winner with more than 750,000 views on her NPR Tiny Desk concert -- traded her acoustic guitar for the smooth tones of a Gibson hollow body, and called upon producer Dwight Baker (MISSIO, The Wind and The Wave, Josh Abbott Band) to lay down five soulful and diverse songs that expand upon her signature style of bilingual Latin folk-pop.

Lightbeam boasts intensely personal lyrics - “heaven knows our souls, our story / the shape of your heart when you hold me / wouldn’t tear us apart or disown me” - strong melodic hooks and a pop aesthetic that showcase Chavez’s versatility on five unapologetically personal tracks that explore longing, faith, beauty and sacrifice. Fresh off a 14-country tour as an ambassador with the U.S. State Department, Chavez and her band are touring the U.S. in support of Lightbeam.

The group expands and contracts as the music and projects seem fit but contributing musicians include Bailey Blu (drums/piano/vocals), Sophie Cozine (vocals), Al Nardo (bass), Stan Simons (vocals) and Ruby Wang (violin).

668,Glass Caves,"Beginning their life busking on the streets of York, before heading to almost every corner of the UK, the band quickly amassed a loyal and devoted following, who appreciate their no-nonsense, back-to-basics brand of self-promotion; something they have in common with the industry tastemakers that followed soon after.
Such was strength of those first initial ripples, that they rapidly became waves, and the band quickly found themselves playing a headline Club NME at London's KOKO, The Great Escape, Dot to Dot, Isle of Wight Festival, and Reading & Leeds amongst countless other well-received dates that continue to cement their reputation as one of the UK’s best loved touring bands.
Not content with being on top of their live game alone however, the band’s DIY roots and inexhaustible work ethic recently caught the attention of the BBC, who commissioned a Newsbeat documentary charting their rise from back-street buskers to major radio darlings, while their self-funded debut 'Alive' made Record Store Day's Top 40 at the time of its release.

In spirit and performance however the band more closely epitomizes bands like Butthole Surfers, The Black Lips, and Fat White Family with their mischievous, iconoclastic, and grotesquely charming energy.  Both clever and aggressive, the band thrash through would-be-pop songs, observing their surrounding from the depths.  In the past year they have supported acts such as The Black Lips, Dead Boys, Surfbort, Roky Erickson, Tropical Fuck Storm, Shannon & The Clams, Jacuzzi Boys, Bodega, Bambara etc.  Gnarcissists just released their self titled EP, a raw 4-track 7” on their own BLISS label, and are currently in the process of finishing their first LP.

-Nylon Music
Based in the burgeoning music scene in Provo, UT (birthplace of Neon Trees, Imagine Dragons, and The Aces,) Goldmyth is a virtuosic singer-songwriter making irresistible electronic-pop music in an unusual way: the harp.  
Influenced by artists like Joni Mitchell, James Blake, and Sufjan Stevens, Goldmyth seamlessly blends glimmering harp chords with weighty synths and springy percussion. Yet, Goldmyth’s artistic voice might be best captured in her poignant, vulnerable lyrics and otherworldly vocals. She was heralded by Hilly Dilly as having “an earnest fragility in her lyrics and vocal delivery that seem beyond the years of an artist early in her career,” as well as “undisputed skill in crafting tight, concise indie-pop compositions.”
Goldmyth’s critically acclaimed debut EP, Faded Dream, released in 2017, was produced by Grammy nominee, Nate Pyfer (Kaskade, The Moth & The Flame) and Mason Porter (Haarlem, Polytype.) Line of Best Fit called her single, Has To Be Better, “a quietly brilliant synth-pop gem,” while Kick Kick Snare proclaimed, “All that glitters is not gold, but is Goldmyth.""

679,Gong Gong Gong,"工工工 (Gong Gong Gong) is the duo of Tom Ng and Joshua Frank. Formed in 2015 in Beijing, China, they make music from the sparest of means: one guitar and one bass, interweaving riffs and rhythms to create forward-charging, drummerless grooves. Their inspirations extend from Bo Diddley to African and Southeast Asian folk music, psychedelic drone, and the structures of electronic music. 
Together, the duo explore the concept of “phantom rhythm”—between their two instruments, an aura of ghostly snare hits emerges over a thumping low-end pulse. Atop this framework, Ng sings in his native Cantonese, recounting tales of absurdity and fragmented visions.
Active members of the Chinese music underground, Gong Gong Gong have nonetheless remained an anomaly—outsiders who call Beijing their home. After a series of self-released tapes recorded in underpass tunnels, subterranean art spaces, and on weathered 50-year-old guitars in a Hong Kong high-rise rehearsal studio, Gong Gong Gong released their first US single, Siren 追逐劇 on Brooklyn’s Wharf Cat Records in November 2018.

Label deal done, Busy Bleeding was quickly followed by 'Marfa Lights' - Goochies ode to their favourite US art hub in the West Texas high desert, Marfa. So go take an earful of Busy Bleeding & Marfa Lights and get ready for 2019 to be officially known as “YEAR OF THE GOOCH”!!! More songs and many more shows to come!

On arrival, the couple devised a unique artistic process to work from, Kinsella describes it as a “collaborative conscious alignment.” The most unique aspect of this creative method involves the writing of the album’s lyrics. “We agreed on 12 books we thought most relevant and came up with various systems to collapse and collage them into each other in different combinations,” Kinsella says. That list included titles ranging from Don Quixote to The Outlaw Bible of American Poetry. Drawing from this source material, Kinsella and Pulse employed a sort-of literary mash-up, scrambling content and structure into a thoroughly new product. “We might take the form of an Eskimo genesis

690,Graham Van Pelt,"“I’d like to be as un-mysterious as I possibly can,” Graham Van Pelt says. He’s about to release Time Travel, his first record in the four years since he moved from Montreal to Toronto, and he’s no longer Miracle Fortress, or Inside Touch, or any of the aliases he’s used to record over the years. He’s just Graham Van Pelt.
With the perspective of leaving a longtime home, of watching old friends change and familiar places become unrecognizable, came a recommitment to an emotional honesty in Van Pelt’s songwriting. Time Travel’s eight songs are a tangle of friendships and feelings. Moving backwards and forwards in time, they occupy a space of elegant melancholy.
Immersing himself in the work of house music legends like Larry Heard, Vincent Floyd and Maurizio and the fragile disco of Arthur Russell, along with contemporaries like Jessy Lanza and Kelly Lee Owens, Van Pelt built the album from the bottom up, rooting every track in the crude sequencer of the Roland SH-101 synth, a decades-old dance music totem. The result are melodies that are simple but affecting, anchored to deep, wandering basslines.

Their first three releases chart a sonic evolution from the lo-fi Everlasting (2010), to the symphonic Golden Age (2013) to the pop-driven ZUNI (2015). Songwriter Aleks Martray attributes his eclectic sound to a nomadic coming of age across three continents and a decade of touring, during which he met frontwoman Shari Bolar.

694,Greenwave Beth,"One-half of well-loved Sydney band, Flowertruck, Greenwave Beth is the dark electro-pop duo of singer Charles Rushforth and drummer Will Blackburn. Their music captures what frontman Rushforth calls “a dance of agony”: that space where we move to the rhythm of our own anxieties and desires. The result is a delicate breed of electronic music – a sound with an angelic John Maus on one shoulder, and a demonic David Byrne on the other. Greenwave Beth released their debut EP “People In Agony” through Dinosaur City Records in 2018, combining the restrictive and industrial sounds of midi-sequenced drum and bass with free form songwriting. It’s a coming-of-age story that's unnerving and electrifying at the same time. Greenwave Beth are making their USA debut this March, supporting NZ indie royalty The Chills at sold-out shows in Portland and Seattle before settling into SXSW.

Spare in texture, emotionally turbulent. Chance blends insight and irresolution with a sensitivity many artists three times his age have yet to achieve. His latest work stems from years of reflection and life choices, all which have brought him to this point. After a stint away from music, in which Chance was at university, his perspective began to change.
Freed from the pressures of the industry, and surrounded by the romantic wildness of his native Oklahoma, he felt a surge of self-discovery he hadn’t anticipated. This has led Chance to his second chapter. His commitment to candor as well as his disciplined but deeply emotional vocals are found present in his latest releases. As Chance puts it himself, his truth in music is much simpler than he originally thought: “I can never give up on the process now. It’s always with me”.

697,Grim Streaker,"Grim Streaker plays a mixture of snotty, mid-tempo punk of late-70s New York and London, with a dose of the fast, abrasive hardcore that emerged in L.A. and D.C. in the early-80s, alongside a hint of angular, moody post-punk. The band’s sound lies somewhere between that of X, The Fall, Sonic Youth and Fugazi, and more recent acts like Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Surfbort and Downtown Boys.
Singer Amelia Bushell, guitarists Dan Peskin and Micah Weisberg, bassist Bill Dvorak and drummer Piyal Basu formed the band in late 2016. Since then, the group has been making a name for itself in the venues and DIY spaces of Brooklyn, with live shows quickly becoming known for the wild stage antics of Bushell.
Grim Streaker released its first single, ""Guts"" in January 2017, produced by Mike Kutchman (Parquet Courts, WALL, Bush Tetras). Stereogum called the track, ""one of those introductions that arrives fully formed while still promising even more to come.” 
CLRVYNT wrote that Bushell was “Courtney Love, Exene Cervenka and Kathleen Hanna all rolled into one, with an alto that cleaves her bandmates’ Adolescents-style tantrums in two.”
Their debut album will be released this Spring.

Born and raised in small-town Michigan, Grivo is led by guitarist/vocalist Timothy Heck who founded the band with his brother and drummer Matthew. The Heck brothers have shared a life-long musical partnership, starting as jazz-obsessed teenagers before diving into the punk and hardcore scenes of the Midwest in their early twenties. After years of intensive touring, they sought new inspiration and slower tempos, opting to relocate to Austin in 2015. Timothy adopted a reserved and accessible approach to songwriting, evoking empathy through minor key signatures while constructing intricate walls of auditory mass. Within the tidal sound waves and bleak timbre, Grivo forges a distinctive personal connection that challenges the modern definitions of doom metal and shoegaze

Aside from beating off stiff opposition (The XX, Laura Marling & King Krule) to win the much coveted IMPALA European Album of the Year Award, the German duo have toured relentlessly - a sold-out headline tour and support tours with Kraftklub and Wanda in Germany and Shame and The Go Team in the UK - and still found time to pen In My Head's highly anticipated follow-up. Despite it's bold title and seemingly warm connotations, upcoming single and first taster of their new material single Hot Summer was conceived on a very grey day in London. The pair tried to capture ""that feeling of despair when everyone around you is happy, but somehow you just don't feel it"" and produced by Richard X (Roisin Murphy, Goldfrapp, Kelis,) the result is no-nonsense anti-summer anthem. The Hot Summer festival tour included playing a bumper section of over 20 European festivals this year, including performances at Rock Am Ring, Melt, Fusion, Deichbrand, Lollapalooza Berlin and many more.

710,Gymshorts,"Gymshorts Bio: (Providence, RI)
This four-piece punk dynamo from Rhode Island, is everything you want in a punk band: brutal, unrefined, and absolutely thrashing. With songs like, “Daylight Savings,” on which the band asserts, “I wish every day was daylight savings/an extra hour of sunlight/ an extra hour to get high,” they are exactly how you’d expect them to be offstage; upbeat, hilarious, New England punks who’d like nothing more than to goof off and make music with their friends. However that impression partially collapses when they mount the stage, strap into their instruments, and reveal their sludge-coated surf riffs and drums that sound both wildly anarchic and assertively tight. GYMSHORTS has been fiercely touring the U.S for the past few years supporting acts such as La Luz, Tacocat, Ron Gallo, The Frights, Death Valley Girls, Hunny and Naked Giants.

As a producer, Halima uniquely blends electronic music with bedroom Pop/RnB to create something both nostalgic and new.
Following in the footsteps of other female R&B singers, Halima has found her music as a way to process her relationships to others, but most importantly the vital relationship she has with herself. Halima’s latest single ""Do Better"" is an introspective ode to self-love with an upbeat hook that complements her soulful R&B voice; it’s a graduation from the artist’s slower last release, ""If Love was Green,"" that teased at the themes of this track. Condemning her previous self-destructive behavior, Halima decides it’s time to put herself, her needs and her desires before that of anyone else’s.

The Deli Mag describes, “The Indie-pop wunderkind’s songs operate within very traditional realms of pop, dreaming of idyllic scenarios in the city with your crush, going on drives and truly living life. These themes may sound trite on paper, but it’s the modern production flourishes that make these vicarious adolescent excursions so intoxicating.""

His soul comes alive on the dancefloor. Ascribed as “emotional dance music,” Hazey Eyes calls upon the throbbing heartache of the early ‘00s alt-rock epoch while splicing it with shimmering indie and electronica aesthetics. He pulls on those strings once again for his new EP, Love Lost, an effervescent elixir of gluey hip-hop and mood-based pop-art. Only 22 years old, mastermind Thomas Michel has cultivated 63 million streams on Spotify, so, it’s no surprise he’s landed touring gigs with Shallou and Petit Biscuit.
The new project is Michel at his most vulnerable. Opener “Scars,” featuring Yoke Lore, sees him reveling in the past and its lasting imprint on his skin. “I will always fall hard” echoes one of his most candid lyrics, paired with a glittering, erratic beat to calm his nerves. “Hungover You,” alongside Moli, buzzes the fingertips but swerves more freely between somber lo-fi whispers and the feverish club-rave we’ve come to bask in. The Dresage-featuring “Living Wild” washes over the listener in cool drip-drops, while “Too Young” woos you into a vulnerable state.......................

Throughout 2018 the duo have been alternating visits to each other’s hometowns of Minneapolis and Austin to co-write original material. Inspired by their favorite classic duos such as Nancy Sinatra/ Lee Hazelwood, Serge Gainsbourg/ Jane Birkin, Sonny & Cher, and Sam & Dave, their influences have spanned everything from doo wop, classic duets, musical theater, electro dance, and melancholy pop.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.",Soul,Rock,"Minneapolis, MN",http://audio.sxsw.com/2019/mp3_by_artist_id/4f040b7221546e6cb0e555a051099891af88a202ad1232c7dc6ec0f7d56b38d7.mp3,Heart Bones at Esther's Follies,"Mar 13, 2019",12:30am-1:15pm,Esther's Follies

Add the sentimentality of 70’s inspired harmonies, combined with a progressive lyrical wisdom to invite positive change, and you can see why they are taking the international folk music scene by storm. Since releasing their debut album in 2013, The Heart Collectors have been making waves internationally – recording two studio albums in Texas; representing Australia with showcases at South By South West Music Festival 2016, ’17, ’18; and launching their music on the UK and Irish scene with their first tour in 2017. There, they enjoyed the warmth and receptivity of UK audiences with a 60 date tour. With soaring cello, intricate guitar, sparkling mandolin, boot banging banjo, and passionate strikes of a tambourine, these four charismatic, happy performers create real musical synergy, with a marriage of progressive folk feels, rock sensibilities and clean classical precision.

On  the  third  and  fourth  volumes  of  From  The  Series  of  Songs  “Altogether  Unaccompanied”,  the  Montréal-based  artist  has  amassed  a  collection  of  memories  in  song  form,  more  like  a  box  of  old  photos  or  unsent  letters  than  a  traditional  EP.  
“The  songs  are  to  be  considered  as  their  own  little  things,”  she  says  about  her  unconventional  release  structure.  “They  are  part  of  something  larger,  yes,  but  they  live  on  their  own.”  As  a  listener,  however,  there  is  an  undeniable  cohesion  to  Vol.  III  and  IV,  and  to  the  previous  iterations  of  the  project:  each  song  is  nostalgic,  intimate,  and  indelible.  
“I’m  learning  to  be  really  patient,”  she  says,  “I  can’t  really  force  writing.  When  I’m  ready  to  write  a  song  the  words  and  melody  are  usually  there.”

The ten songs on Hembree’s debut reveal a band filled with the confidence that is required of those who sound self-assured while discussing themes of indecision and uncertain identity.

737,Henrik Appel,"After thirteen years at the heart of Stockholm’s garage scene, Henrik Appel is finally going it alone. Since moving to the Swedish capital at the age of twenty, he’s established himself as one of the key figures in the city’s indie rock underground; after starting out playing bass in the punk outfit Kilroy, he met the similarly prolific Martin Savage and joined his band, Martin Savage Gang, handling bass and backing vocals as the group toured across Europe and the United States. Working with Savage inspired Appel to step out front and centre himself, and in the summer of 2016, his new three-piece Lion’s Den released their self-titled debut album, one that had Appel on lead vocals and guitar and on which he penned the lyrics himself.
Lion’s Den continued in the Appel tradition of tightly-wound guitars and sharp melodies, with a quickfire running time and lyrics that reflected on the world around him. All the while, though, he was working on something that would mark a break away from the musical identity he’s spent over a decade cultivating. Burning Bodies is Appel’s first solo album, pieced together over the course of five years and consisting primarily of love songs that pertain

They have played many gigs in the capital and all along the country, supporting different local and international bands like Mujeres (Barcelona), The Parrots (Madrid) and Peach Pit (Canada), and also, they have played in the European DIY Music Conference. This year, they have played in festivals like FIB 2018, Sound Isidro 2018 Ebrovisión 2018 and Get Mad 2018. 
Their first EP is Diamond Munch, an unpredictable and contradictory mixture. Here is where feelings and thoughts of each member flowing across the creation process assemble with humanity on it, encouraging each one to shape this work. Distorted or wildly naked guitars, a set of voices that covers the entire vocal spectrum, basses with great presence and more rhythms than minutes of songs: an X-ray of the lives of its members during the creation process. Their peculiar style goes from lo-fi garage to 90s post-punk, what they finally have called Glitter-punk, coining this term as a personal brand.

747,HIJOS,"HIJOS is one of the experimental pop rock bands with the highest projection within the emerging music scene in Costa Rica. At present this group is comprised of Ali Mondol, on drums; Marvin Picado on the bass; Diego González on synths; and Pablo Rojas, as lead vocalist and guitarist.
The sound of HIJOS is a metaphor for San José as a city: embedded in the center of Costa Rica, halfway between South America and North America, between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, in the middle of everything; and taking influence from everyone. Thus, HIJOS vibrates with the sound of a city where the rhythm vibrates with a sophisticated subtlety between the trumpet, the jukebox, vinyl and the guitar.
The band’s first album, NU9VE, was dropped in 2016; several video clips and live sessions were released as part of their promotion. Recently, HIJOS was in charge of the soundtrack for the short El Gran Líbano, which was included in the film Lebanon Factory, which premiered at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival (2017).
On October 18, 2018, they launched their second full-length album, entitled Sol Naciente, considered one of the most outstanding Costa Rican releases of the year.

They released a deluxe version of their award-winning sophomore album, The Wilder Beyond, on February 1st, 2019.

During this time, he released his music on some of the largest independent music labels to date, including Buygore, Fool’s Gold Records, Dim Mak Records, and Monstercat. He quickly garnered the attention of many critically-acclaimed electronic producers– namely Rezz, Zeds Dead, Bloody Beetroots, Machinedrum, Bassnectar, Noisia, TOKiMONSTA, and more. Deemed ‘one of the top producers of 2017’ by both DJ Mag and Run The Trap, Holly clearly has had no trouble gaining recognition from both artists and fans alike. More recently, Holly has heavily geared his efforts toward producing innovative rap and hip-hop projects for numerous artists, such as ProfJam, Dengaz, Bloody Jay, Slow J, and Papillon. Holly’s engaging on-stage presence and innovative sound have catalyzed his emergence out of the SoundCloud scene and rapid growth in the electronic music scene.

I could not  not I could pigeonhole myself in a musical genre since my nuances and harmonic colors are a perfect reflection of my rebelliousness and freedom while I let lyrics letter to vibrations that speak of love and synchrony, because my main objective is to make music for the soul.

755,Honey and Salt,"For Honey and Salt, there is immense power in the parts of a whole. This idea has always been in the band’s DNA, from its three members -- each with their own distinct and essential contributions -- to the flurry of interlocking notes and melodies that make up their intricate songs. Now on their self-titled sophomore album, it also extends into their worldview, as Honey and Salt seek to cut through the pessimistic fog of seemingly inescapable sociopolitical unease, and highlight the vital capability of the individual. Where many bands look for commonality amongst its members’ tastes, Honey and Salt revel in their differences, seamlessly blending their disparate influences into a sound that manages to be complex without sacrificing immediacy. The self-titled album deftly utilizes everything from Kinsella-esque guitar lines, to post-rock dynamics, to hardcore ferocity — all while packing an emotional resonance straight out of DC’s Revolution Summer — and finds the band completely comfortable with balancing their intricacies.

757,Honyock,"Far from tilling barren ground, Honyock have claimed an out-of-the way territory to cultivate their own unique musical sensibility, laboring for friendship, brotherhood, honesty and the sheer joy of the process, far from any fame or treasure-seeking notions. If their profile is rising now, it’s at the best possible time. 
The result of a dream made manifest, El Castillo (out July 20th, 2018) serves as the band’s debut LP, part stylistic rebirth and part distillation of every quirk and feature that has made Honyock distinctly appealing since they first appeared. Produced by Father John Misty's David Vandervelde, it features the band's nimble songwriting with a playful pop sensibility, allowed to breathe in the loose-feeling structures of ballads and power-pop suites, imbued with the fractured grandeur of ‘70s guitar rock and glazed with the clean shimmer of ‘60s optimism, though it’s not without a minor touch of wistfulness to make the melodies bittersweet. Honyock regularly dips into serious territory while avoiding the theatrical pitfalls that can derail truly thoughtful handling of the subjects covered. They’re a group that can use artifice without becoming a background to it.

762,Hot Flash Heat Wave,"San Francisco band Hot Flash Heat Wave rose to prominence in the Bay Area music scene in 2015 with the release of their debut album Neapolitan and their 'Gutter Girl' music video, which later exploded in popularity on Reddit. Their versatile sound, at times reminiscent of psychedelia, dream pop, and post-punk, demonstrates a dynamic range of songwriting prowess centered around consistently infectious, sun-soaked melodies and guitar hooks.
HFHW formed in Davis, California as a noise pop collaboration between Adam Abildgaard and Nick Duffy in 2010 and added Ted Davis in the following years amidst a series of lineup changes. Renouncing the traditional front-manned format of most contemporary bands, the members instead each contribute songs and share the lead.
Continuing their habit of self-reinvention, the band has generated growing excitement with a series of ambitious new singles from their forthcoming EP, Mood Ring, set to release on Feb 15 2019 via EMPIRE. The new material teases a dreamier, more psychedelic and indulgent sound, and has landed the group spots on Spotify playlists like POLLEN, Bedroom Pop, Modern Psychedelia, and All New Indie.

775,i.D. the G,"i.D. the G has an unique display of gritty lyrical finesse with an authentic mix of street resolve and soulful eloquence. Raised in Chicago’s Chatham neighborhood by his mother (teacher) and father (educator & former DJ), the native Chicago emcee spent his adolescent years studying the elements of the culture [Hip Hop]. It was only a matter of time before the art of emceeing and graffiti became a part of the daily regimen for him and his crew (TCO). Influenced by the likes of Wu Tang, No Limit Records, 2Pac, Common, Lupe Fiasco, Lil Wayne, and Curren$y, he forged his own unique artistic style and presence. As i.D. continues to promote what he uniquely calls his “D-boy B-Boy sound” worldwide, he has toured and performed in Europe and many cities across the U.S., including Austin, Texas for the annual SXSW Festival, and Atlanta, Ga, at the A3C Hip Hop Festival.
Backed by his marketing company, 23 Entertainment, in 2019 i.D. dropped the 3rd installment of his “June Jordan” EP series - “June Jordan: 3 Peat”.  The name was influenced by an annual release date of June 23rd, which is also his birthday. This latest release prompted the “3 Peat Tour”.

776,Iguana Death Cult,"Rotterdam’s Iguana Death Cult hasn’t exactly been shy about causing havoc on whatever stage they set foot. That’s likely been the one constant since establishing their giddy brand of protopunk and garage rock on debut LP 'The First Stirrings Of Insect Life'. Iguana’s pending follow-up 'Nude Casino' marks a swift and sobering departure from the miasma of psychedelics they purvey so fervently. But no less intense: this band has been sharpening their tools, reemerging from their concrete cavern with a ragged and convulsive post-punk attack akin to Devo, The Gun Club, and Richard Hell.
Playing an abundance of shows – at small clubs, squats and festivals such as The Great Escape, Lowlands, c/o pop, Plissken and Reeperbahn – has whipped Iguana into even more ferocious live band, and that experience carries over in the recordings. Like The Clash and Minutemen before them, Iguana Death Cult have embraced the art of rocking the fuck out with all senses and impulses up to eleven. Rapturously sinking in their claws, and never letting go.

Their two-decade ride  has taken them  all over the  map  musically  and  geographically, yet the inescapable patina of their hometown infuses every note they play. Through  eight  studio  albums,  countless  tours  and  Jazz  Fest  appearances,  and  a  flood  that  did  its best  to  take  their  adopted  city  with  it,  it's  a  testament  to  the  band's  endurance  that  the  same  four guys  that  started  playing  in  the  early  1990s  are  still  together.  Joe  Cabral is  philosophical  about  the bandʼs  persistence  in  the  face  of  challenges  that  would  have  felled — indeed have felled — lesser bands. “First of all, this is all we know how to do; weʼre musicians. But more than that,” he continues, “we respect the power of the band as an entity, and each individual in the band steps up to play his part. When itʼs good, thatʼs really what itʼs all about.

Over the past few years, six consecutive singles have been added to high rotation on Australia's national radio broadcaster Triple J, accompanied by sold out shows around the country and appearances at festivals such as Laneway and Lost Paradise.  In August 2018 the band released the single 'Landmine', which has truly been the outfit's biggest statement to date. Indicative of the lofty ambition inherent in their debut album, 'Love Is A Landmine', slated for release in  2019, ""Landmine"" marks a new beginning for the band. It revels in shimmering 70's soft rock glory but it is the channeling of this influence into something exotic and new that has truly dazzled audiences. Released in February 2019, their follow up single ""Heather"" has people predicting that I Know Leopard's album will be one of the breakthrough Australian releases of the year.

780,Illiterate Light,"Spanning the better part of a decade, the creative evolution between Jeff Gorman and Jake Cochran is far from ordinary. The duo ran an organic farm in the Shenandoah Valley, toured the mid-Atlantic by bicycle,  and lived in small communities while pursuing modes of alternative education. Their eclectic background is mirrored in Illiterate Light's sound and lyricism, floating between postmodern confusion and vibrant, life-affirming optimism. Formed in the summer of 2015, Illiterate Light transcend expectations of typical rock music through their limitations as a duo. Gorman elevates his gritty guitar melodies and honest lyricism by stomping out thunderous synth bass with his feet as Cochran layers lush vocal harmony and explodes with body convulsing energy around his minimalist standing drum kit.  Gorman and Cochran’s incessant writing, commanding live performance, and near constant touring promise a bright future as they finish their debut album with Vance Powell (Jack White, Kings of Leon, Chris Stapleton) and Adrian Olsen (Foxygen, Natalie Prass). Their recent EP, “Sweet Beast"", is the first taste of what’s to come from Illiterate Light.

781,illuminati hotties,"Despite the pluralized nom de guerre, illuminati hotties is the creative outlet of Sarah Tudzin - a producer, engineer, and burrito aficionado hailing from the sprawl of Los Angeles. Armed with bright white shortveralls and a rotating line-up of Sarah’s bffs, illuminati hotties has been lighting up stages across SoCal since Fall 2016 with playfully interweaving guitar lines, relentless rhythmic momentum, and strikingly self-aware vocals. Lauded as local “tenderpunk pioneers,” illuminati hotties has perfected the blend of sweetness and ferocity, of celebration and despondency, in their debut album, Kiss Yr Frenemies.

At first listen, illuminati hotties is a sun-drenched, irreverent volley with the onset of adulthood, but as the listener dives deeper, they will find an earnest consideration of musical phrasing and deliberately crafted wordplay regarding the complexity of love, loss, and skateboarding. illuminati hotties’ live show challenges audiences to bring their deepest feels and fiercest moves to the floor, and has elicited comparisons to Best Coast, Angel Olsen, Courtney Barnett, and Alvvays.

784,Indianola,"“There’s a duality present in a lot of these songs,” says Indianola’s Owen Beverly. “There’s a push and a pull that’s constantly going on. The music is modern and retro and optimistic and bleak and carefree and apocalyptic all at once."" Those juxtapositions lie at the heart of ‘Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye,’ Beverly’s thrilling debut LP under the Indianola moniker. Recorded at Shovels & Rope’s studio in Charleston, South Carolina, the collection stitches together a broad range of genres and eras, gleefully toying with decades of music history in order to create a sonic collage from an alternate timeline, one in which snarling garage rock guitars flare up alongside 60’s girl group melodies and greasers and punks party with velvet-voiced crooners. Beverly mines the past like a found footage artist, seizing on unexpected moments from long-forgotten productions in order to splice them together in a wholly new context. The result is utterly engrossing and infectious, a pop culture Frankenstein that sounds like Roy Orbison fronting The Sonics or Buddy Holly soundtracking a B horror flick.

785,Indigo Sparke,"Singer/songwriter from Australia, Indigo Sparke, has been transmuting her vivid experiences into music from a very early age.
Her presence transports you back to the Golden Era, when wild self expression was met with reverence. She invites you with her music to remember the importance of this freedom. 
Haunting and mesmerising, her ethereal angelic and at times eerie melancholic vocals, coupled with her deeply poetic storytelling take you through the chambers of a soulful youth who has loved, fallen and risen again to stand once more and sing her tales.
Her music slips between genres and epochs from indie-rock to folk-pop to poetic lyricism, influenced by Joni Mitchell, Jeff Buckley, Radiohead and The Doors.
Following the release of her EP 'Nightbloom' in 2016 Indigo has performed a number of solo shows across Australia and the US at festivals such as Splendour in the Grass and other intimate venues, as well as supporting bands and musicians such as Big Thief, Jack River, and Melody Pool to name a few.

The multi-instrumental band’s other ‘not-nots’ encompass traditions from across America, including bluegrass, Appalachian fiddle tunes, jazz, and minimalism.  Invoke weaves all of these styles together to create truly individual music written by and for the group.
In 2018, Invoke won First Prize at the M-Prize International Chamber Arts competition in Ann Arbor, MI (Open Category), as well as First Prize in the Coltman Competition in Austin, TX, and most recently, the Concert Artists Guild Victor Elmaleh Competition in New York. Invoke was also the 2016-18 Young Professional String Quartet in Residence at the University of Texas.
Invoke’s 2015 debut release Souls in the Mud, and their 2018 follow-up Furious Creek, both feature original works composed by the group. Invoke believes in championing diverse American voices, including their ongoing commissioning project American Postcards, which asks composers to pick a time and place in American history and tell their story through Invoke’s unique voice.

792,Irata,"There's a fantastic bumper sticker that simply reads ""evolution isn't over.""
This could also be Irata's slogan. Since its 2007 genesis at the hands of founding members Jon Case (bass, vocals) and Jason Ward (drums, vocals), this Greensboro, NC outfit has mutated restlessly, moving from its initial Morphine-infused heavy fusion through math-y metal and finally to the soaring, technical heavy rock of its current approach. Over those dozen years, too, Irata has made its presence known in metal and hard rock circles throughout the Southeast and beyond. Now, and thanks to its growth from a trio to a four-piece with the addition of guitarist Owen Burd, Irata is evolving yet again.
With Burd's talents on guitar, vocals and trumpet added to what had already felt like a complete equation, Ward notes, Irata is pushing itself to new vocal and instrumental heights. Accordingly, its upcoming LP Tower applies impressive musicianship and complex textures to increasingly approachable tunes that teeter between hard rock and prog-metal. It's like the sports car version of Don Caballero.

797,ISLAND,"London four-piece ISLAND are an Alternative guitar band whose history is characterised by old friendships, close bonds, and an almost telepathic mutual understanding. Forming as teenagers when frontman Rollo Doherty’s acoustic bedroom project was treated to the boisterous backing of guitarist Jack Raeder, bassist James Wolfe and drummer Toby Richards in a dingy windowless practice room where they began to shape a sound which combined darkly twisting instrumental with a sweetly melodic songwriting nous that belied their age. The quartet released their debut EP ‘Girl’ in late 2015 and its shimmering refrains immediately turned heads. Their follow up EP 'A Place You Like' continued their undeniable rise and further garnered new fans both domestically and internationally. Early 2018 they released their critically acclaimed debut album, ‘Feels Like Air’.
The band’s live show is fearsomely tight and effervescently energetic through years of playing together week in, week out since their youth. Over the course of little more than a year, they sold out all their London headline shows including the iconic London KOKO and Scala, and shows at The Great Escape, London Calling and Reeperbahn.

As a Charlotte, NC native and current resident of Philadelphia, Ivy’s sound draws on a diverse set of influences. Sole is the product of the gospel and soul upbringing afforded by her hometown, the mainstream R&B and backpack hip hop of the late 90s and 2000s, and an organic obsession with indie rock that she’s cultivated into a soundscape that's all her own. 

Sole's debut mixtape project EDEN was released in April 2016 to a welcoming community of hip-hop heads and hipsters alike, and it was ranked #27 on Bandcamp’s Best Albums of 2016 list. In 2017, she released the two-part project EAST and WEST and was featured as Spotify’s Fresh Finds spotlight artist. After 3 projects, two tours, and a lot of wisdom gained, the self-released indie returned full force with her first full-length studio album, OVERGROWN, in September 2018.

802,Izaak Opatz,"Izaak Opatz is a mountain man (from Montana)! He works in National Parks, cutting trails through the woods, probably wearing a vest or a funny hat and crapping in holes in the ground. He goes weeks on end without seeing another single person. When he does finally wander into town, he usually comes back with a pack-mule-donkey-satchel-thing chock full of songs about women that he’s been dreaming of, places where he used to be happy, situations he screwed up… really dipping into a well of memories that are probably better left alone.
…you hear the songs and you’ll be won over immediately. You watch him play and you’ll wish he’d never stop. You talk to him for a minute and you’ll offer up your prettiest daughter and welcome him into your family. But if you turn your back on him for even a minute, he’ll probably wander back up the mountain and give up whatever you offer him, no matter how sweet the sitch or pretty the daughter. He’s got his own agenda and it’s frustrating but also so admirable. My advice is to catch him whenever and however you can and celebrate this sensitive mountain man while he’s around.  ~Jonny Fritz

807,Jackie Bristow,"At once heartfelt and sophisticated, Jackie Bristow combines subtle but beautiful melodies and hooks that hypnotise the listener, demand complete surrender and then stick around with the backbone of a real friend.
Born in New Zealand but then transplanted to Australia and now the United States with a guitar, suitcase and songs, Jackie travels light but packs a heavy punch.
Jackie has had the honor to be the opening act for many of her musical heroes. Opening for Bonnie Raitt in New Zealand on her 2013 “Slipstream” tour was a dream-come-true. Jackie was invited back 2017 to join Bonnie Raitt on her “Dig in Deep” tour. Jackie opened for Foreigner, the Steve Miller Band, Boz Skaggs and Chris Isaak 2018. 
Jackie’s live performances captivate audiences. One reviewer of her show on the Tommy Emmanuel tour wrote: “Opening for a musical giant like Emmanuel would seem a daunting task, but Bristow was relaxed as her soulfully-seductive melodies reverberated within the auditorium. Her beautiful voice and earnest songs resonated with the audience, and they applauded her eagerly. Near the end of the show, Bristow joined Emmanuel on stage for an amazing duet that received a standing ovation.”

809,Jackie Mendoza,"Born and raised in the border city of Chula Vista, California, Jackie Mendoza has found inspiration from her motherland of Tijuana, Mexico, to create quirky, intimate and ecstatic electronic pop, building sophisticated sonic structures and textures with Latin-driven beats. Singing in both Spanish and English, her songs explore love and relationships: how wonderful love can be but yet so painful and confusing at the same time; from unrequited love to “firsts” and “lasts”; about coping with and releasing emotions; learning to believe in yourself through it all; feeling out of touch and foreign in your homeland; and even long-distance relationships and seahorses… Her first EP will be released in 2019 and was produced by Rusty Santos, who also teamed up with Panda Bear on his forthcoming album Buoys. Their collaboration has been seamless and inspiring. As both have lived between California, New York and Mexico, they immediately agreed on the direction Jackie’s sound should take. When she appeared at SXSW in 2018, she was featured in NPR’s AUSTIN 100 and spotted by THE NEW YORK TIMES as one of the best acts of the festival.

810,Jackie Venson,"""It is legend that a blistering Jackie Venson guitar solo knocked Pluto straight out of planetary existence""
Venson’s “…astonishing mix of raw soul, superb musicianship and laid back grace…” (Austin American Statesman) has been compared to the likes of Joss Stone, Amy Winehouse and fellow Austin native Gary Clark, Jr. Originally a classical pianist, Jackie picked up the guitar, shortly after graduating from Berklee College of Music, and made the giant leap from the tradition of classical music to the raw and gritty blues and soul.
Enthralled with music since the age of 8, this young singer/songwriter/musician instantly captures your attention with a vibrant musical soul and passionate control of her instruments, that reach far beyond her age. As she mindfully blends Blues, Rock, R&B, Soul and more with her introspective lyrics, the message is clear- when you’re listening to Jackie you hear the “Truth in Music”.
Her live performances revisit what makes music so powerful: emotion and passion. She thrives without the flash, instead favoring a clean sound, genuine soul, and meaningful connection with her audience. Music is not only what Venson does – it's who she is!

This polished producer conjures masterful arrangements and sound design from his expansive collection of analog synthesizers and drum machines. The unmistakable charm of vintage instruments inspires Schrock’s penchant for sound design and has become the driving force behind his work. At the age of 19, Schrock enrolled in sound recording school where he met fellow student Michael Stein, who would later become a member of electronic quartet S U R V I V E and an Emmy award winning composer for the massively successful Stranger Things soundtrack. Schrock and Stein became instant friends and bonded over their mutual love for analog electronics while sharply honing their studio engineering and production techniques.  Schrock‘s work is confidently playful, exuding an aura of lighthearted sophistication unique to contemporary synth culture.

817,James Cam'Ron,"
For Chicago-raised artist James Cam’Ron, the interplay of community has always proven central to everything he does, and the turn up has always been real. While many get into music or art to prove something, Cam’Ron’s foray into the sonic waves of the world was instead a natural outgrowth of the world he found himself occupying on a day to day basis. Nestled amongst a cross-section of talented, alternative-leaning hip-hop acts during the early days of the Chicago Renaissance, the Englewood native learned to play his part, observe and study while working on his own thematics to offer to the world.
“I come from sort of an alternative side of the scene and shit, I spent a lot of time watching everyone, going to parties and finding my way,” said Cam’Ron. “I was trying to be around everyone, around what was going on up north and up west, being at Music Garage, I was just trying to be where everything was poppin and felt a gravity pulling me that way.”
Having spent the last half-decade collaborating with a range of local talents across many mediums, James focus is aimed to bring the creatives of the city together with good vibes central to the theme as always.

Droll’s name is not indicative of his sound; his words can pierce with venom or plea with agony or place barriers between him and loves lost. He’s firmly built his niche in the New-Nashville pop spectrum and sinks his teeth into any of the sounds that are coming from this progressive scene.

He also had a Beats by Dre ad, and was featured on Eminem's 'MMLP2' album. Commons won Music Week's Sync Artist Of The Year in 2016. This year Commons composed the music for the summer blockbuster “Skyscraper” starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. These experiences opened his ears to a spectrum of genres, making him more interested in the path pop music is taking. The KIDinaKORNER/Interscope Records artist is working on his first full length album which will be released later this year.

That wasn't the case. When Psychopomp was released to acclaim in 2016, she was forced to confront her grief. Zauner would find find herself reliving traumatic memories multiple times a day during interviews, trying to remain composed while discussing the most painful experience of her life. Her sophomore album, Soft Sounds From Another Planet, is a transmutation of mourning, a reflection that turns back on the cosmos in search of healing.
""I want to be a woman of regimen,"" Zauner sings over a burbling synth on the album's opening track ""Diving Woman."" This serves as Zauner's mission statement: stick to the routine lest you get derailed, don't cling to the past, don't descend. In fact, ascend to the stars; Zauner found artistic solace removed from Earth, in outer space and science fiction. ""I used the theme as a means to disassociate from trauma,"" she explains. ""Space used as a place of fantasy.""

Our fans are our greatest priority - we love them, we really do, and we do our best to insure them that we can’t do this without them. Our message is one of acceptance, not in a circle sitting kum-baya bullshit way, but in a way of acknowledging that we all have shit we regret, we all have passions and opinions, and it's up to all of us to filter through our flaws and our regrets to find ourselves and love one another.

After years of independent releases, he made international headlines with the ARIA Award-winning breakthrough single “Do You Remember” in 2015. Certified triple-platinum in Australia, it captured #1 on both Hype Machine and the country’s iTunesTop Songs chart in addition to becoming “the number one most Shazam’ed song in Australia for 2015.” As the song racked up over 91 million Spotify streams, he attracted the endorsement of Beats 1 Radio’s Zane Lowe, Elton John, and Ed Sheeran who famously disclosed to Rolling Stone, “I just love his sound.”

832,Jason Hawk Harris,"Years before developing his own brand of confessional, cathartic country music — a sound he describes as ""meta-apocalyptic country/Americana grief-grass"" — Jason Hawk Harris chased a different muse as a classically-trained composer. 
After writing thousands of measures of classical music, though, Harris found himself drawn back to the country, folk, and rock music that had soundtracked his early childhood. He'd grown up listening to classic crooners like Hank Williams, Roy Orbison, Jim Croce, Patsy Cline, and Elvis. 
Harris began cutting his non-classical teeth with the Show Ponies, an Americana group based in L.A. He played guitar for the band and produced most of their albums, racking up several million Spotify streams along the way. 
""I love country music because it's built upon a collision of the sad and specific,"" says the songwriter, whose music evokes comparisons to imaginative Americana frontmen like Daniel Romano and Robert Ellis. ""I want to treat it like an art form. I want to show people how seriously devastating it can really be.""

Then, following the 2016 release of her debut album proper, Parma Violets, came a serendipitous SXSW performance that would ultimately lead to her signing with Canvasback and Hand in Hive.
Her EP, The Moths of What I Want Will Eat Me In My Sleep went down with aplomb on either side of the Atlantic earlier this year. Lead single 'Plastic Skeletons' was debuted by NPR and has seen UK radio support across BBC Radio1 (Huw Stephens' Tune of the Week),6Music, and more. She recently recorded a session for Stephens at Maida Vale.
2018 also saw her taking slots at Latitude festival and The Great Escape and dates with Haley Heynderickx, Elbow and Belle and Sebastien.
Her latest EP, Wisdom Teeth is quite possibly the most eclectic Jealous of the Birds set to date: from the raw energy that drives the angular ‘Blue Eyes’ to the dexterous, playful indie-pop of ‘New York Has a Lump in Her Throat’; the dream-like ‘Kosikelu’ and the widescreen majesty of Clementina. It’s led by the lush and thoughtful ‘Marrow’.

THAT’S HOW SHE TELLS HER STORY ACROSS COSMIC WINK — HER THIRD ALBUM, AND FIRST FOR MEXICAN SUMMER — ALL OF WHICH CAME TOGETHER IN THE MIDST OF A SERIES OF TRANSITIONS IN HER PERSONAL LIFE.
In 2016, after living in Austin on and off for a decade, she left her home state of Texas for California. Deeply inspired by the move to Los Angeles and the bliss of new love, she rented a back house from an actor friend who was away on a movie and started writing the songs that eventually became Cosmic Wink. As she wrote, her beloved dog Frankie began going gray with old age.
All three of these seemingly dissimilar streams intersected to give Cosmic Wink a unified sound and feel. The openness of LA — and confronting the downbeat nature of her older songs while performing to hushed European crowds — challenged her supposition that “heartache, depression, and sadness” were “the only way to make interesting music,” as she puts it.

Through three EPs and 2 LPs on Joyful Noise, has seen him garner critical acclaim and tour and play with the likes of Unknown Mortal Orchestra, Alvvays, Wild Nothing, Kikagaku Moyo, Ezra Furman and Mitski,
Fernandez starts skeletons of songs with an organ and a Casio drum machine. Through endless revisions and tweaks, he builds and rebuilds each into complex arrangements. With 'Occasional Din' he mines the sound of the past; drawing influences from vintage Italian pop and soundtrack composers like Bruno Nicolai, Alessandro Alessandroni and Mina, as well as their American contemporaries like The Free Design and Margo Guryan. Lyrically, Fernandez expands on previous themes of isolation by exploring topics such as climate change, trend-forecasting and data collection. The result is a playful pop record that holds a kaleidoscopic mirror up to our need for escapism.

In the early nineties, young Jim-E-O, a fresh transplant from Imo State, Nigeria, settled in New Haven Connecticut with his family. Enyinna Ogbaa, his birth name, would travel into Midtown Manhattan on the train and stare out the window, captivated by the frantic hustle & bustle of the Big Apple. Through NYC’s madness, there was a beacon whose sound, language, dress and art would open his eyes and command his attention - there was a connection. The CEO and founder of My Executive Room gazed at the promotional posters, heard the boom bap of Hip Hop’s “Golden Era” emanating from storefronts and cars, while the street’s hieroglyphics known as graffiti provided the backdrop. He was hooked! This love would propel him to branch out to follow his dream of becoming a artist. As an artist Jim-E-O was chosen to perform at a BET music matters showcase in Austin, Texas,which landed him on 106 & Park.

856,JM Stevens,"West Point, Mississippi native JM Stevens likes to wear a suit to work. Maybe it's all those times he watched his dad leave the house so full of purpose, so clearly identified as a working man. It’s an unassuming look for a power pop extraordinaire. 
Praise has piled up over the years. The Austin Chronicle tossed around phrases like “perfect summer album” and “rock-solid barroom pop salvation” to describe his work with Moonlight Towers, the band he founded in 2001. Little Steven Van Zandt named their song Heat Lightning the coveted title of “Coolest Song in the World” on his radio show, Underground Garage. Heavy airplay followed, and even legendary producer and Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham called the song one of his “tops of the year.” 
Stevens shrugs off the accolades and the criticism with equal aplomb. “I’m just tryin to make cool shit"" he says, with a serious expression, and what truly could be more profound than that? (Following the whims of his artistic vision remains his only prerogative.) 
Although newly minted as a solo performer, Stevens has already devoted a lifetime to music, and the proof is abundant. New album out this year.

Three and a half years ago, the two sisters from northern Germany, Josepha Carl (vocals, drums, electric guitar) and Cosima Carl (vocals, piano, electric guitar) aka JOCO, took the country by storm with their debut album Horizon. And not only all of Germany, but even neighboring countries fell under the spell of their alluring, fluid voices. In addition to countless concerts and festival tours, they played alongside the NDR Big Band and in Van Morrison's Program, as well. They were also honored and celebrated as the most exciting newcomer of 2015.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.",Pop,Indie Pop,"Hamburg, GERMANY",http://audio.sxsw.com/2019/mp3_by_artist_id/a5674c54fb89d281ebd94437677bf02ab9f823d4e78aa0e08ff359d12e634b02.mp3,JOCO at Elysium,"Mar 11, 2019",1:00am-1:50am,Elysium

Contributing to Brownwood’s We Out Here project with the track “Go See”, Joe released his debut album “Starting Today” in May 2018.
On ""Starting Today"", Joe, “takes a modern-jazz journey from the discrete influences on that eclectic London sound to its thrillingly diverse present - and stakes his claim as one of the scene’s most promising voices.” (Pitchfork).  Slipping in elements of house, 2-step, reggae and broken beat into his jazzy style, the album “distinguishes the pianist and composer as a soulful, modern producer” (Redbull).  
Touring the album, Joe Armon-Jones showcases these talents alongside his ability to excitingly and passionately lead the band with a deep love for music and appreciation of the moment.

Johnny Nicholas has  spent a lifetime soaking up the flavor of such vibrant music scenes as Chicago, Southwest Louisiana and Texas ( home  for 40 plus years). His repertoire of predominantly original compositions is full-spectrum Americana — a rich gumbo of blues, cajun, swing and  honky tonk. 
 Drawing on all of the above,  Nicholas’  Fresh Air was acclaimed by Downbeat magazine in their “Best album releases of 2017” list. It is a highly satisfying  collection of songs and stories establishing  him as a modern troubadour to be reckoned with. 
His 2018 release “Too Many Bad Habits” reissue package  was just nominated for a  2019 Grammy.

864,John Paul White,"With The Hurting Kind, John Paul White has crafted a stunning album that draws on the lush, orchestrated music made in Nashville in the early 1960s. Yet these songs retain a modern feel, whether he's writing about overwhelming love, unraveling relationships, or the fading memory of a loved one.
White grew up in tiny Loretto, Tennessee, and now lives in Florence, Alabama, not far from Muscle Shoals. He has cultivated his career in Nashville for two decades, first as a songwriter for a major publisher, then as half of The Civil Wars – a groundbreaking duo that won four Grammy Awards before disbanding in 2012.
Because The Civil Wars were so hard to categorize, White has earned a fan base among indie rock listeners, folk audiences, Americana outlets, and AAA radio. So, what will happen if people hear The Hurting Kind and call it country? “Well, that doesn’t scare me in the least,” he says. “As a matter of fact, it kind of thrills me.”

865,John The Martyr,"Born at the crossroads of good old-fashioned Harlem soul power and next generation New Orleans sounds, the story of John The Martyr starts on a New York City subway. This is where a 26-year-old NOLA native heard 70-year-old Harlem son, Bill Hudson, singing with the doo-wop outfit called Spank.
“They blew me away,” he recalls, “I grew up listening to artists like The Temptations, The Drifters, and James Brown, so it brought me back home.""
Kyle and bill bonded in the studio and continued to work together on creating some new tunes. “The first thing I said to him was, ‘I think you should find a younger guy, number one’,” laughs Bill. “I liked what Kyle was putting down though. It had a feeling. It wasn’t generic. There was no classifying it.”
“I just knew that the bond we had was special,” recalls Kyle. “I wanted to listen to his voice more and more. He’s a young guy at heart. There was a lot of patience from him, and his wisdom is so crucial to this band. We’re constantly learning from him.” 
Kyle shared a handful of demos with friend, Dustin DiSalvo, and after bringing together a collective of 11 musicians, John The Martyr was formed.

Between 2000 and 2014, JV released 10 records on Barsuk, Dead Oceans, and Secretly Canadian, and collaborated as a producer and musician on records by Spoon, the Mountain Goats, Okkervil River, Death Cab for Cutie and Tune-Yards. In April 2018, Vanderslice decided to leap back into his solo career with full force, hunkering down for over 50 days in his San Francisco studio Tiny Telephone in a process that yielded The Cedars—Vanderslice’s most ambitious record to date. The Cedars (Native Cat Recordings 2019) approaches the craft of songwriting from every direction but the front, in a non-linear process driven by drum machines, synthesizers, and an unpredictable palette of sonic textures. In an act of getting both figuratively and literally lost in the woods, Vanderslice finds himself favoring chaos and deconstruction over well-worn paths of familiar sounds and instrumentation.

With the purchase of a guitar and baritone ukulele, Vincent taught himself to play as he was recording. He moved further along with this process, and suddenly, a project obtaining themes such as love and nature was produced to fruition.

All of them came from other bands with many years of experience but none were prepared for the instant chemistry and ease of making a whole new sound together. The band's name reflects this idea of unity, Jonathan being a metaphorical single person with a blend of character traits and whimsies from each.
 
Five experienced musicians have ever since been on a mission to tear down geographic and linguistic borders. Jonathan officially appeared on Croatian scene in November 2013 with a single “Maggie” which was an instant hit. Accolades from music professionals and audience were only confirmed upon release of their debut album “Bliss” in May the following year. Jonathan became one of the bands emerging on the regional music scene, being high in quality and most noticeable.
Not keen to confine their music to a single genre, they are quick to point out their past in alternative and punk rock scene. Jonathan prefers to define themselves against other indie bands of today with a sound raw with primal energy and sarcastic lyrics delivered with genuine feeling. Their music is maybe best describe

His recent music video for 'You're So Cool' has become a YouTube sensation, drawing viewers with his unique masked up mod band and it's eerie surreal production. Bree's live show is as equally captivating and otherworldly - both aurally and visually.
A self-confessed workaholic and social recluse, Jonathan spends his days (and nights) in a dingy home office attempting to run his record label Lil’ Chief Records whilst simultaneously producing for other artists, directing and starring in music videos for duets about Cigarette Smoking (yes THAT video) and then somehow finding time to record his own material when he should be sleeping.
Bree began writing and performing music as a child and by age 13 had released on New Zealand's Flying Nun Records.
At age 19 he formed the band The Brunettes, writing and producing 4 albums and 4 EPs for them. The Brunettes went on to sign with Sub Pop before eventually disbanding in 2010.
Bree then slipped into the shadows, resurfacing in 2014 as a solo artist with his masked baroque band, and has now released 3 solo albums.

Secret Weapon is a record of time; of place; of circumstance. It was made in Jo’s hometown of Melbourne with VCA college buddy Shane Byron on a setup she affectionately refers to as “really dinky.” “The apartment smelled like mildewy laundry and Australian summertime in a way I love,” recalls Jo. “We cobbled together all the equipment we had and swore at it a lot.” 
Jo’s history is rich with unexpected circumstances. She began as a church organist and jazz pianist, which took her from Melbourne to New York City. She gigged around NYC with a smattering of colorful creatives. Amongst others, she worked as an accompanist of Hugh Jackman, Bobby Rydell and Lana Del Rey. She made an EP with King Creosote and contributed keys to works by The National, Kelli Scarr and Phosphorescent. Eventually, she settled into her steady role as touring member of Phosphorescent.

Incoming full length ‘In The Blank Space’ takes this conversation further, a broad but stunningly concise exposition of supple strings, textured vocals, and digital excursions. One thread that consistently moved through her work are those gorgeous classical elements; whether that’s her treatment of melody on the supple, piano-driven ‘Once Apart’, her exploration of tone on ‘Feral Thing’, or simply incorporating a string quartet on the title track, ‘In The Blank Space’ points to the future while looking back to her past. “I think that’s maybe why I’m not only an electronic artist, but I’m also not just a singer-songwriter,” she insists. “I do both. I produce and I write songs."" Her technical autodidacticism is allied to a searing ambition, an unrelenting creativity. It’s the sound of someone who utterly loves music bringing this creativity into resolute focus, a conversation between the organic and the digital, between her inner world and that urge towards communication.

But as everything was coming together for them, singer-guitarist Judah Akers' family was falling apart in a hail of alcoholism and affairs, death and divorce. From that tension comes Pep Talks, the trio's third LP and a hard left turn into deeply personal terrain. Knowing they had something new on their hands, Judah, Brian Macdonald (mandolin), and Nate Zuercher (banjo) took their time crafting a set of songs that not only shores up their one-of-a-kind sound—a heart-pounding whirl of folk, bluegrass, rock, hip-hop and electronic production—but takes the listener on a bracingly candid, surprisingly anthemic journey from the kind of pain that tears your whole world apart to the sort of hard-won hope that can bridge the deepest of rifts.

She makes 70’s inspired Americana music for an international audience, not by mimicking her favorites from afar, but by making pilgrimages across the southern US to find the right connections, tone and feeling. Over the years, Judy has performed with artists such as The Wood Brothers, Seasick Steve and Macy Gray. She's one of a handful of artists to wow audiences as intimate as Nashville's famed Bluebird Cafe and as grand as Amsterdam's 18.000 seat Ziggo Dome. She keeps it real and humble, focused on making her music as authentic as she is. 
Her second album, ""Morning Sun"", was recorded by Chris Taylor (Elle King, The Wood Brothers) at Southern Ground Studios (Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson), and appeared in Sep 2018 via V2/Munich Records. Within a month it reached a million streams on Spotify. ""1995"", her latest single, was added to the favorites playlist of none other than living legend Elton John.

Returning home to California, Lucille spent a year honing new material, some of which appeared on a 2012 solo effort titled Homing. A move to Texas yielded a 2016 collection of lo-fi demos called Bedroom Tapes, Vol. 1, followed by a proper follow-up album in the panoramic and more fully formed Chthonic, which she recorded in Dripping Springs with Cross Record members Emily Cross and Dan Duszynski.

Juliana Hale was created to be on stage and in the studio sharing her voice and heart with the world. From the moment she starts to sing, something magical ignites in a room. With a rich alto voice and unique style Juliana immediately captivates anyone who hears it. Whether on stage with her world-class band, sitting at home on her piano or writing a song on the bus with her guitar, Juliana’s heart beats to music.
In the second quarter of 2018 Juliana released her 4 song EP “Small Talk”, produced by Grammy Award-winner Skidd Mills. Small Talk was based upon the petite singer’s own heartbreaking personal experience, showing her penchant for poignant lyricism and upbeat musicality.
Juliana’s latest single “Cupid” is the first new original track since the summer ’18 release of Small Talk.  Stripping away the synthesizers and drum machines, “Cupid” presents Juliana Hale’s music in its rawest and most naked form: just piano, cello, and vocals. 
Having made the difficult choice to walk away from over $600,000 in scholarships to prestigious, private universities last year, there is no question that Juliana is giving 100% to make her dreams a reality.

In between there is the prowling blues of “Final Verdict” to the horn-laced “Beggars Can’t Be Choosers,” so reminiscent of the late Otis Rush and the glory days of Chess Records. The Texas-style shuffle of 
“I Got This”, the funky soul of “Always Fooling Me”, and the rabble-rousing rockabilly of “Grow Some” are all testaments to Kathy & the Kilowatts enviable command of an array of rootsy, yet modern genres.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.Artist is seeking the following professional connections: Management, Brand Partnership, Gear Endorsement, Distribution - UK/Europe, Distribution - Worldwide, Other Artists to Tour With, Booking Agent - US, Booking Agent - UK/Europe, Booking Agent - Worldwide, Sync/Music Supervisors",Rock,Blues,"Austin, TX",http://audio.sxsw.com/2019/mp3_by_artist_id/f57c813798a6ea1c163599a9168a4e0fd04b45e0665cca4bde2d737a3b00f482.mp3,Kathy Murray and the Kilowatts at Saxon Pub,"Mar 12, 2019",8:00pm-8:40pm,Saxon Pub

Elsewhere he tackles modern domesticity (the Harry Nilsson-esque “Cold Shoulder”), and ends on an apology of sorts for his choice of lifestyle, “I earned my degree but I would rather rake some leaves.

The Pittsburgh-born GRAMMY®Award-nominated artist, multi-instrumentalist, and producer echoes the kind of grit meant to be smoothed out only on vinyl and emanates the ambition of a 21st century festival draw on his 2019 full-length debut, HOAX [AWAL]. Beyond gigs alongside everyone from Alessia Cara to Mumford & Sons and electrifying festival performances at Bonnaroo, Latitude & Longitude, and Sasquatch, he contributed “Pray You Catch Me” to Beyoncé’s blockbuster Lemonade, sharing co-writing and co-production with the superstar and James Blake. 2017 saw him sell out his first headline tour before spending 2018 recording the new album. Now, his brand of bold and blunt soul unfolds on HOAX and singles such as “In Case I Don’t Feel” and “Faith You Might.”

20-year-old Connecticut-born singer, songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Kevin George pieces together a nocturnal soundtrack perfect for a midnight metropolitan cruise. 
On this ride, smoky synths emit a neon glow like street lights, warped guitar transmissions wail, thick beats skitter and speed up, and silky vocals soar. (Picture an after-hours club headlined by The Weeknd fronting Tame Impala and you’re just past the velvet rope...) This haze of alternative soul, fashion-forward R&B, and hip-hop bravado established George as a quiet phenomenon since his emergence in early 2018. The artist’s debut EP, LOVELAND, yielded a hit in the form of “High Like This,” which clocked over 2.2 million Spotify streams in under three months. Meanwhile, the follow-up FORTINA boasted the fan favorite “She Don’t Love Me” [feat. GUNNA]. In the aftermath of its arrival, he garnered early acclaim from The Fader, Pigeons & Planes, and many others and landed a deal with Young Forever/Island Records. 
The music represents him at his core.

Let the rhythm absorb you, your blood turn to oil. You become part of the machine, the machine that is driven by the motor of Komfortrauschen. Three precision-obsessed control freaks that have honed their craft to a German industrial perfection. An uncompromised sound welded together from propelling drums, deep unrepentant bass lines and a searing guitar that bites through like acid. They convert their mechanical energy into hedonistic live techno that is impossible to resist. Only thing is, there is no emergency stop!
Komfortrauschen is a live band from Berlin that creates the powerful sound of a techno DJ set in their very own analogue fashion with traditional instruments, filtered through an impressive array of pedals and effects.

Rebellion pulses beneath the surface of Kyan’s sound, from its raw instrumentation to its experimental orchestral interludes and outros, full of unexpected modulations. 
Kyan’s productions have been described as ‘a hazy cloud of Channel Orange meets Purple Rain goodness’ (Notion Mag), from the Radiohead-esque solitude of ‘Neighbours’ and Beatles-like wonder of ‘Lonely River’ to the choral harmonies of ‘Don’t Want To Let Go’.
‘The kid’s a genius, I thought he was like a young Mozart’- Nile Rodgers.

When he received the news that a dear loved one had passed away, he knew it was time for a drastic move.
Emerson packed up and moved back to Colorado, where he found his footing and completed the album full of swift fingerpicking, tell-all lyrics, the slickness of LA and the earnestness of Colorado. Emerson’s music has been compared to the likes of Big Thief, Elliot Smith, and Andy Shauf.

Their desire for playing at bigger stages and festivals was growing on them, so during 2016 and 2017, they put on hold the recordings and went touring all over Mexico City, stage after stage, venue after venue. During these years, L3ON got a larger base of fans.

976,Labrador,"Labrador released their debut EP, “Tell Me About Your Dad,” in November, 2018. Their songs might best be described as country-shoegaze fingerpicking meditations smothered in dreamy vocals on the insidious nature of patriarchy and how it destroys relationships. Songwriter Hannah Switzer describes the Madison four-piece’s sound as something you might hear in The Bronze on an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Her use of an unusual four-string electric tenor guitar gives the songs a bright, almost stripped-back quality that showcases Switzer's intimate lyrics and vocals, while Lawrence Gann’s tight drumming creates intricate undercurrents. Originally formed as a two-piece by Switzer and Gann in 2017 after the two became instant friends at a bar show, Labrador has grown over the last year with the addition of Grant Kempski’s lead guitar and Kent Genis’ steady bass. The Madison, WI band began to garner attention when their EP was featured on NPR’s Pop Culture Happy Hour in 2019.

977,La Chinga,"La Chinga was born in Vancouver, BC in 2012, although in reality it was conceived about a year earlier when bassist/vocalist Carl Spackler was surfing in SoCal and his chicano beach buddies kept hailing each other with the mysterious phrase. 
“La chingaaaaa!” 
We’ll spare any sensitive unilingual anglophones the meaning; what matters is that Spackler’s dream of a hard rock power trio built on erogenous funkadelic rhythms and a devotion to life’s more sublime pleasures—chief among them: tequila—was now embodied inside a beautifully obscene two-word incantation.
Drummer/vocalist Jay Solyom and guitarist/vocalist Ben Yardley—also a noted professor of theremin—were conscripted shortly after, both veterans of Vancouver’s notoriously dead-end music scene, both beautifully obscene in their own right. La Chinga’s self-titled debut record was rushed out of a makeshift studio in 2013 on nothing but fumes and the liberating force of not giving a shit, landing like a hairball crossed with a stink bomb inside a world of yoga pant commerce, condo developments, and Macbook “musicians.”
This was a revolutionary act—or maybe a devolutionary one, at least.

979,La Force,"La Force is Ariel Engle, vocalist and newest member of Broken Social Scene. The music of La Force is nocturnal electronic pop, featuring Engle's enchanting vocals over dynamic production.
Her presence resounds on Broken Social Scene’s 2017 album, Hug Of Thunder, lending fluid, commanding vocals to the oblique anthem “Stay Happy,” and leaving an indelible mark on the collective’s rousing performances. Stepping up to the role first helmed by the immeasurable talent of Leslie Feist, Engle brings La Force's singularity to the familial energy of Broken Social Scene.
Born out of the culmination of AroarA – her musical project with husband and Broken Social Scene bandmate Andrew Whiteman – La Force is a deep reflection on the magic and dismantlement of motherhood; the never-ending tightrope walk of life, and death; and the re-discovery of self.

986,Larkins,"2018 saw the band flourish, with a seemingly endless run of shows that took in some of the UK's most iconic venues and best-loved festivals, while they also made their first foray into mainland Europe. It was a year that saw Larkins grow and evolve into the sleek, well-oiled outfit that they are today.
Latest single ‘Something Beautiful’ is the first taste of that maturing process to be released, and it bristles with a cocksure swagger that epitomises their new outlook perfectly. Produced by Chris Zane (Friendly Fires, Passion Pit), it eschews the button-bright indie-pop of previous releases (such as the fittingly titled ‘Sugar Sweet’) in favour of something darker and more refined. ‘Something Beautiful’ draws on the ubiquitous touch of the band’s soul and R’n’B influences, resulting in a single that’s both frenetic and funky, proving once again why Larkins are one of the most impressive and versatile bands doing the rounds at the moment. With a whole host more to come in 2018/19, Larkins' meteoric rise looks set to continue with the announcement of their biggest ever headline show at Manchester's Albert Hall and the announcement of the signing to Good Soldier Songs

Written partly in the gray claustrophobia of the German winter and finished in the vast golden expanse of the California desert and the gritty glare of L.A., “Empty Sea” boldly oozes the confidence and swagger of a survivor. Laura Carbone moves effortlessly here from sexy tribal stomp to delicate beauty, Brecht-ian mystique and beyond. Prepare to be charmed and disarmed, battered and bruised, to ultimately emerge from the depths of the “Empty Sea” grasping desperately for the “REPEAT” button.
Berlin-based Laura Carbone’s latest single, “The Flowers Beneath Your Feet”, saw her joining forces to duet with Kip Berman of NY’s The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart on this sparkling, noisy dream pop diamond-in-the-rough.

From learning how to sing in church throughout childhood to then moving to California to study classical music at California Institute of the Arts (CalArts), Laura Jean has carved her way by writing songs about her life while working odd jobs, busking, and playing live in any capacity ¬ a testament to her reverence and embodiment of classic blue-collar musicians of yore who built careers on painstaking hard work and rooted in all things live. 
Her recent music has garnered praise from NPR, Salon, Noisey, The Fader, The Line of Best Fit, and many more. Her debut EP, Lonesome No More, is out now.

Recorded at the historic Nashville studio Creative Workshop with producer/engineer Parker Cason, the Lauren Morrow EP not only showcases Morrow’s flawless vocals and intricate songwriting, but her willingness to take risks — an edge that makes her stand out from the Nashville norm.

Collectively, HoK has heralded a transformation in the landscape of the DIY scene in Texas, opening portals for radical expression within the confines of the state.

He particularly took an interest in all things art with fashion and music at the forefront. As he grew into his teen years, he began creating a signature style that developed as he matured. At 12 years old, Leigh wrote and recorded his first song which led to him jumping head first into music. After graduating high school, Leigh and his family relocated to Atlanta where he could focus on creating music full time. Heavily inspired by A$AP Rocky, Wiz Khalifa and Chris Brown, Leigh’s musical style is undeniably youthful, fun and unique with a sense of self-awareness. In 2019, Leigh premiered his debut project, 5500, which is a nod to his birthday (5/5/00). Leigh’s lead single, “Wood Grain”, sampled the legendary ‘Bad Boyz’ beat from Belizean rapper, Shyne.  Leigh’s mother, who is also from Belize, encouraged her son to go back to his roots and shoot the video on the island with his family. The video, which premiered on Complex, features beautiful scenes from Carnival and truly captures how he fused his life.

He added an extra track, Encéphaline (which won a SOCAN Songwriting Prize), then formally released the EP the following year.

Les Louanges presented his 14 pieces at the Transmusicales of Rennes in France, where he was selected to perform in December 2018. His new album is a good mix of eclectic songs. It’s pop; it’s jazzy (the song Jupiter), with a perfectly balanced amount of R&B (Westcott), hip-hop (Tercel) and chillwave. Great contemporary composers as well as a new generation of forward thinking artists inspire his music.

Plagued with self-repression, neurotic ambition, and delusions of grandeur, Alex created LEX in 2016 to shield polite society from her most socially unacceptable attributes, by redirecting them onto the stage instead. 
With a comically narcissistic persona and a domineering stage presence, LEX delivers surgically precise rapid-fire raps about things she likes, things she’s done, and things everyone else is too afraid to say. LEX is ugly and real, and speaks to the minds of misfits everywhere. A larger-than-life portrait and complete self-expression of one 5’4’’ Asian nerd, LEX is the freshest new rapper on Earth - “not in spite of being a nerd, but because of it.""
LEX has performed at Emerald City Comic Con, MAGWest, PAXWest, SXSW, and Super MAGFest. She most recently toured the country with mc chris and int80 of Dual Core. 
LEX is currently based in Oakland, California. Her full-length debut album, “Raging Ego”, was released on June 6th, 2018 to critical acclaim.

1010,Leyla McCalla,"Leyla McCalla introduced herself with 2013’s Vari-Colored Songs: A Tribute to Langston Hughes. She set poems by Hughes in musical settings of her own construction on the critically acclaimed album, and her plain-spoken voice highlighted the common sense in Hughes’ works. McCalla moved to New Orleans in 2010 to busk on the streets. She also toured as part of the Carolina Chocolate Drops but left to pursue her own music and the project that threaded through it—an exploration of Haiti’s Creole culture and identity. McCalla connected with other Louisiana musicians who work with Creole traditions. That led to 2016’s A Day For The Hunter, A Day For The Prey, which reveals the art and humanity in folk songs. McCalla has kept her instrumentation spare to allow the song to shine, but her upcoming album, The Capitalist Blues, departs from that as she plays with a New Orleans-based band. The Capitalist Blues is different from McCalla’s previous albums, but she hears the connection between New Orleans and Haiti. Many of the themes are extensions of ones she examined on A Day for the Hunter, a Day for the Prey, and even though the lineups are very different, the songs come from the same place.

Liily’s local shows reflect that crazed manic intensity. Their fans have turned up to dance and absolutely tear the place apart alongside the band. Having started out playing mostly house parties and warehouses, it’s only recently that the band has started entering into nightclubs to bring that same energy.
“We like our music to make people crazy,” says guitar player Sam De La Torre. “It has a lot of energy. We want to make people move. When we write something, we want it to hit really hard. If we knock people out, we’ve done our job.”

1029,Lingua Ignota,"LINGUA IGNOTA, the solo project of multidisciplinary artist Kristin Hayter, takes a radical, unflinching approach to themes of violence and vengeance in ways that are moving, brutal, and harrowing. Her music is intentionally situated at specific and strange intersections, incorporating elements of power electronics, death industrial, and black metal alongside baroque classical, spiritual minimalism and folk. Relentless intensity and soaring dramatic arcs are informed by Hayter’s background in classical music, and the major sonic locus of the project is her voice, a dynamic entity that rushes from unhinged screaming to lilting soprano to angular belting. She is notorious for confrontational live performances that can leave an audience breathless or in tears.

1040,Logan Ledger,"San Francisco native Logan Ledger was always drawn to roots music. “When I heard Hank Williams and George Jones it was like a bomb going off in my mind – I became obsessed with older styles of country music,” says Ledger. Nashville eventually exerted its pull on him. “This was a further expression of my archaeological impulse with regards to music-making—I’ve always believed that in order to create something new with purpose, one must be steeped in the past and work from within the tradition (it has more gravity that way).” He continues, “In Nashville I began writing songs in earnest—I wanted to write country music that evoked the darker, mysterious side of human nature and experience.” Renowned bassist Dennis Crouch introduced Ledger to legendary producer T Bone Burnett. Burnett immediately felt musical kinship to Ledger. He signed him to a production deal and facilitated a deal with roots label Rounder Records. Ledger says, “It has been a real privilege to work with T Bone. We share a musical vision for the twenty-first century born from the deep well of American music.” As Kyle Corneos of Saving Country Music predicts, “you’ll want to be paying attention when Logan Ledger hits.”

AJ fronting his heavy-touring Sony recording act Austin rock band, Vallejo for over a decade touring with the likes of everyone from The Black Crowes, Matchbox 20, Stone Temple Pilots & Blues Traveler, and Kendall enjoying national success as a finalist on Season 8 of Fox's American Idol as well as her own solo career.
AJ , being voted 3-time Producer of the Year at the Austin Music Awards, teamed up with Kendall after her Idol  stint recording her 2 full-length albums. The studio relationship during that period proved to be so fruitful that the powerful songwriting duo came together as a duo project to create something new with an undeniable chemistry that carries over into each and every song. 
On their debut EP Love & Chaos, AJ & Kendall bring different styles to the table and somehow manage to consistently find middle ground as they create fresh & exciting music together.

Loving is a Canadian basement-based band comprised of David Parry, and brothers Lucas and Jesse Henderson that most often plays as a five piece. The group came together several years ago as a result of their shared summers working in the capitalist ruins of British Columbia’s forests. Together they create a warm and dreamy sonic landscape kept adrift by existentially-oriented lyrics and an unspecified, all-encompassing sense of nostalgia.

1062,Löwin,"Heavy As the Sun is Löwin’s second release but marks a rebirth in sound for the Austin based quartet.  While Royal Jelly (released in 2013) asserted the band as a member of the Austin rock scene, Heavy as the Sun emerges with a more shimmery pop aesthetic on intro tracks “Sake” and “Maybe It’s Over.” Songwriter/singer Sara Houser switches from guitar to keyboards (her primary instrument) to create a uniformly synth centered record. “I wanted the focus of this record to be more lyrically and melodically driven and for me those ideas come the most naturally when I’m playing piano,” explains Houser. 
That being said, Heavy as the Sun doesn’t lack dynamics or the bombastic post rock moments that are more present in Löwin’s earlier releases. Amidst the glitz are songs like “Hard to Love” which starts off with heavy hitter Chris DeGeorge and Nate Ribner’s signature bass fuzz but then builds into a B52s inspired banger. Guitarist Michael Sanders shines on “Sloop” and “The Wheel” with tones reminiscent of Real Estate and Johnny Greenwood alike. 
Heavy as the Sun was recorded in Austin, TX.

They released their debut album Heba in February 2017 on Bella Union, and it received a glorifying 7.8 from Pitchfork. The album and their altogether expression is eclective, overwhelming and intimate and they top it off with a hint of pop music. 
Their music and lyrics convey a story that is sensitive and sometimes even heartbreaking, but delivered in a very (sneakily) abstract way, so you don’t really know what hit you, until your lying on the floor grasping for air.
Lowly’s next album ""Hifalutin"" will be released in 2019.

This is modern rock n’ roll driven by instinct alone. The perfect soundtrack for a teenage dream. 
From being discovered as a busker on the streets of Glasgow to playing with the likes of Black Honey, The Big Moon, Neon Waltz and The Undertones, their DIY spirit and knack for a dreamwave banger now finds them working with Arctic Monkeys and Florence + The Machine collaborators and coming to a town near you. 
“It was through living in Glasgow that all of these opportunities came to me,” says frontwoman Lucia Fairfull of her early dabblings with music. “I was growing up and going through phases of realising what kind of music I wanted to make. All of the things I was experiencing as a teenager made me into who I am now. For a while, I didn’t feel like I was in any kind of scene in Glasgow - but I knew that it was there.

Luke’s sincerity allows him to win over any crowd.  His work ethic is unmatched and his debut album “Dear Darla” will have him on your radar before you can understand him fully.

1081,Madam X,"DJ, label manager and club impresario Madam X has proven to be one of the UK’s leading underground DJs.
From co-founding label and Manchester Clubnight BPM in 2011, to launching her own label KAIZEN, in the summer of 2014 – her reputation has seen her tour across America, Australia, Asia and beyond, representing the darker sounds of UK bass-driven techno. 
Credited by Mixmag as one of the “Top labels of 2016,” her work with KAIZEN as a clubnight and imprint has armed her with the hands-on experience of releasing records independently whilst also keeping her ear firmly to the ground. 
With releases from Biome, Walton and Silas & Snare, and support from Mall Grab, Loefah, and Hodge to name a few, KAIZEN has proven to be one of the most talked-about labels in left-field bass music.
With the soundsystem pressure of dubstep, the propulsion of techno and a fearless attitude, Madam X’s accomplishments admittedly feel like only the tip of the iceberg. With recent stints presenting Channel 4’s award-winning music show ‘Four to the Floor’, and Radio 1 & NTS residencies under her belt, she continues to build on past successes, clearly set on leaving her mark on UK dance music in a big wayProgramming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.Artist is seeking the following professional connections: Management, Brand Partnership, Gear Endorsement, Booking Agent - UK/Europe, PR/Publicity Agency",DJ,Dance,"London, UK-ENGLAND",,Madam X at ScratcHouse,"Mar 14, 2019",12:00am-1:50am,ScratcHouse

Bringing the audacious and wonderfully talented Tim Durand (drums/vocals) into the picture has recently solidified the band with a roaring sound and strength to complement their vibe. Dedication to their music has evolved The Mammoths from garage rock to sophisticated blues-funk, and constant experimentation has allowed each member of the group to always stay true to their roots. Jekot, self-described as playing in the “grunge-endrix” style, notes that Kapsner’s soul-vocals, Durand’s pure metal, and Tyler’s deep, groovy funk stand out in the realm of rock, drawing influence from all over to create a sound that is entirely new, yet curiously familiar.

What started as early cassette experimentation has now come full circle with a string of acclaimed records for labels such as L.I.E.S, The Trilogy Tapes and Creme Organization and bookings from Mexico to Moscow.
Marcos’ production work began back in the early 2000s with releases on Germany’s Trapez Records and his exploration of the club sound continued with Runaway, a production partnership Marcos formed Brooklyn-based producer Jacques Renault. Together they produced a handful of disco/house/techno influenced records for record labels such as DFA, Rekids, Chinatown, I’m A Cliche, Wurst Edits, Let’s Play House and their own label On The Prowl. 
After years of working with partners in the studio, Marcos recently returned to solitude and is now aiming to convey a more personal message with the aforementioned techno labels.

1101,Marfa Crush,"Marfa Crush is a rock and roll band from Austin, Texas. The music is straightforward, with psychedelic sounds floating through the mix, but the songs don’t fit easily into any category. “I was tired of being in straight up rock bands and wanted to do something different,” says Marlon Sexton, the group’s leader.
Sexton wrote, sang, produced and played all the instruments on the songs on the band’s still unnamed debut in his home studio. He incorporated aspects of electronic music – crazy sounds and unexpected noises - to make it interesting, but kept things rooted in the structure of a traditional rock band. Guitar, bass and drums carry most of the weight. He wrote and recorded the songs in eight months, crafting precise arrangements that come alive when the band plays them on stage. The music carries a lot of emotional weight and breaks out of the verse/chorus straightjacket, with intros and outros that are spacy and atmospheric. The sound is free flowing, but coordinated. “We all know where a song is going,” Sexton says, “but it’s always open to the individual interpretation of the musicians.”

The project Mascarimirì took shape in 1998, when Claudio ‘Cavallo’ Giagnotti and Cosimo Giagnotti (two brothers of Roma origins) chose to end their experience with Terra de Menzu, one of the first bands that, at the beginning of the 1990s, contributed to the resurgence of Salento traditional music. Between 1999 and 2003 the musical project got stronger and more mature and created the new sound: “Punk-Dub Tarantolato Salentino” was the definition used to underline the experimental vocation of the band that inserted into the traditional musical heritage some techniques not used, until then, in the traditional music style of Salento. Claudio “Cavallo” Giagnotti create the vibe called “Tradinnovazione”, the union of Traditional sounds with innovative sound. 
The new 2019 live show titled ""TRADIZIONALLL"" mixes the Pizzica Pizzica sounds with the Arabic and Andalusian flavor, the Tammurriata in electro Gipsy version and the Tarantella Punk “Tarantolato” vibe. 
In 2019 the Mascarimiri are going to release the new single and the new album - eleventh in their discography. #ARRRAA!

1114,Matt Maltese,"Matt Maltese is a man of two halves. On one hand, his bone-dry wit, Leonard Cohen-style vocals and baroque flourishes give him an undoubtedly retro, troubadour appeal. It’s a quality that’s only bolstered by the 21-year-old’s North American parentage (“I feel a certain sense of homecoming [when I go to] Canada that I maybe don't have as much in England,” he says). On the other, this rising singer-songwriter is also a young Brit coming of age in a time of national turmoil, with a true talent for conveying the malaise of today’s world. 
His debut Album Bad Contestant was produced by Jonathan Rado (Lemon Twigs, Foxygen) was released in 2018 to critical acclaim and combine often dark lyrical material with breezier melodies, in the vein of John Grant or a more offbeat Rufus Wainwright.
Maltese’s complex, witty melancholy is certain to see his audience continue to grow, and, in expertly treading the path between opposites -  anxiety and levity, home and away, past and present - he is sure to have an exciting future.

Crushing guitars and driving beats carry pop-savvy melodies sung by the jointly fronting couple.  “They’re not following trends and they don’t seem to have an agenda that extends beyond wanting to play live music in any arena offered to them.” - City Pages, Minneapolis. 
The band’s live shows are known for their raw energy and humor.  Some people remember them for smashing guitars on Stage at The Varsity Theater, while others remember stunts like their infiltration of the 2008 Republican Nation Convention where they serenaded ‘members of the Illuminati.’  “The band is a blitz of post-punk, guitar smashing, wreck the train Rock and Roll that has not been seen since the glory days of CBGB. Behind all the Rock and Roll stance is a band with big brains and big hearts.” - Rock The Cause Records.  The band toured heavily in North America including such noteworthy performances as...

1116,Mavi Phoenix,"At 11, Phoenix’s Dad gave her a laptop for Christmas, and she quickly began making beats and loops in GarageBand, inspired by Foo Fighters as much as Eminem. “Music was an escape,” Phoenix says. 
As a producer, songwriter, and performer, Phoenix has never been afraid to blaze her own trail. Her genre-mashing three EPs and one-off singles to date have drawn unexpected links between pop, hip-hop, and electronic sounds, and listening to them in sequence can feel 
like a thrilling plunge into a selection box of assorted musical treats. In this way, her multifaceted music sticks a middle finger up to the narrow margins that women artists can be forced to exist in — Phoenix can be an Amazonian warrior, hedonistic party girl, and confessional songwriter in the space of an 18-minute EP. 
A resolutely independent artist who releases on her own LLT imprint (the name stands for Love Long Time), Phoenix now has global domination in her sightline, and she’s resolutely determined to achieve that status on her own terms.

She counts Michael Jackson among her biggest inspirations, and it’s not hard to hear hints of Eric Johnson as her fingers glide across the fretboard, but there’s no denying that Faye is a uniquely modern artist: raised a Jehovah’s Witness by chemist parents, she counts R&B star SZA among her earliest fans, and her first exposure to her instrument came through the Guitar Hero video games.

1137,Merely,"In ancient stories, fairy tales and mythology, different tropes are often used to symbolise the powers found within all of us; for example, The King and Queen represents internal struggle and justice, and The Warrior represents courage and willpower. On the other hand, The Wizard is more ambiguous and represents the esoteric sides of the human psyche - insight, spiritual growth, a kind of messenger between worlds. 
If Merely’s first two albums “Nirvana” and “Uncanny Valley” were her manifestations of The Warrior and The Queen, “Hatching The Egg” is The Wizard - a new incarnation, imagining her as the lead singer in a super group composed of the best renderings of her past self, all disguised as fable animals and creatures from the other side; an album painted with a palette of psychedelic, dreamy pop, shoegaze, chamber music and subtle hints of progressive rock.

1145,Mike Krol,"Power Chords, Mike Krol’s new Merge release, picks up where 2015’s Turkey left off. It traces Krol’s journey back to punk rock, harnessing both the guitar technique and the musical redemption referenced in its title. He’s wielding the same influences—Misfits, The Strokes, early Weezer, Ramones—but turning up the gravity and the gain. Indeed, Krol has gone somewhere new; yes, he bludgeoned himself with over-analysis and self-loathing, but along the way he stumbled upon a trove of intricate guitar lines and artfully mutating melodies.
Music ruined Krol’s life. And then saved it. In chronicling that process, Krol has made his best record—painful, voyeuristic, and angry, but ultimately transcendent and timeless. It is the sound of Krol giving in to a force greater than himself, as though the chords are playing him rather than the other way around.

1147,Miki Ratsula,"Ever since I was young, music has been an escape for me. While others my age were out with their friends, I was in my bedroom singing and writing songs. For a long time, it was my little secret. Until my freshman year of high school when I uploaded my first YouTube cover online. I slowly built a following around my music, but it wasn’t until I came out as gay that my music and following grew exponentially. I began writing love songs about my girlfriend and sharing my experience as a gay demigender woman. My most recent work is influenced by a diverse body of music, combining elements from acoustic singer-songwriter music with elements from electronic music and R&B.
My goal is to change the pop music industry and give LGTBQ+ love and relationships the representation that they deserve. I want my music to be enjoyed by everyone, including those outside of the LGBTQ+ community. I wish my younger self would have been able to hear a song on the radio written by a girl for a girl or see a woman who values her masculinity. For this reason, I strive to be the role model I never had.

Along the way she wrote songs of love, loss and everything in between which became the building blocks for her debut and sophomore Eps, Berry Hill and Good Luck, Honey.
Her debut single Ice Cream & Cigarettes reached No.2 in Spotify’s US viral charts, whilst single Honey has enjoyed great success at AAA and College radio and she has been supported by Billboard, Paper Magazine and Pop Matters.

1157,Miya Folick,"Miya Folick’s debut album Premonitions — out on Terrible Records and Interscope — is a vision of a more compassionate human future. “I wanted to imagine an existence that’s more natural — where we understand ourselves with more subtly,” Folick says. On Premonitions, she creates a communal world where people care for each other, are demanding of each other, and, sometimes, just want to be alone. 
Pervading Folick’s distilled, haunting, and emotionally immediate first two EP’s -- Strange Darling (2015) and Give It To Me (2017) -- is a sense of deep empathy and desire for connection, but also a tendency toward solitude. Perhaps these themes can be traced to her upbringing in the Jōdo Shinshū Buddhist tradition, where her parents taught her about living with mindfulness — though, she says, she doesn’t always remain true to this in her own life. Or, it could be from the eternal sense of not quite belonging that Folick has carried since growing up as a child of mixed heritage in the suburban neighborhoods of Santa Ana, California. Being an outsider created a tendency in Folick to observe the nuances of how others experience connection or lack thereof.

From Stevie Wonder and Ella Fitzgerald to Blake Mills, Sigur Ros, and Solange. Most recently, she has had the pleasure of performing with and learning from Wyclef Jean. Her jazz-infused, neo soul songs are the product of this varied musical education. As a songwriter, Moira finds her confidence in self-deprecation and biting honesty. Her lyrics are loose-lipped explorations into the uncomfortable. She frequently exposes secrets in her songs that would otherwise be guarded by sobriety. Her constant need to unsettle is carried through her artistry, and, intentional or not, she never gives the same performance twice.

1162,Molly Burch,"Molly Burch burst onto the music scene in 2017 with her debut album Please Be Mine, a ten-track ode to unrequited romance. Please Be Mine earned praise from critics for her smoky, effortless vocals and bleeding-heart lyrics. “I was really blown away with how many people told me that the music has helped them through their own break-up,” she says. “I was just so moved by that, so [with the next album] I wanted to reveal my own struggles with fear and anxiety.” First Flower is a walk-through Burch’s most intimate thoughts. Unlike Please Be Mine, which focused on the contentious depression of heartbreak, First Flower explores broken friendships, her relationship to her sister, and more importantly, how Burch learned to fight overwhelming anxiety. Burch is a soft-spoken, careful person who shoves her nervousness away on a daily basis. First Flower is a bright, beautiful album peppered with moments of triumph. Burch’s voice is as strong and dexterous as ever, displaying her incredible range and professionalism as a vocalist.

1163,Mom and the Mailman,"Mom and the Mailman is the brainchild of Long Beach native Malcolm Bennett, 25.
But wait — was it the other way around?
Well, whatever it was, or happens to be now, is really beside the point.
There’s new vision here. It’s an infant’s eyes unfurling out into the bright lights, limbs
spastic and syrupy, freshly emerged from a bloody womb. It’s Metal Machine Music,
haunted by a wayward spirit wailing out through the auditory abyss.
Despite that referential description however, Mom and Mailman is not wrapped in a
morass of marketing according to its influences. There’s only a glue-drenched guitar
(hurling through the maw of a beast incubating in the unknown), the rhythms of a jarring
drum machine, and of course, Malcolm, the main man himself.
All the existential weight of self-conscious inquiry is absent. There is no “what are you
trying to say?” moments with Mom and the Mailman. There are only answers,
accusations and artillery.
Mom and the Mailman need a place of their own, preferably when the kids aren’t home.

Gustav and Vanilla met when he saw her DJing at an underground club in Norrköping and was blown away by her set. Introductions were made, songs were swapped online and they decided that their shared musical taste made collaboration seem a worthwhile endeavour.
Out of that collaboration came ‘TTYL’, a song that’s since racked up over 1,300,000 streams, been featured on sites like The Line Of Best Fit, GoldFlakePaint, Pitchfork, GorillaVsBear and more. And in a slightly more left-field bit of appreciation, it was also played by the Irish actor Cillian Murphy when he sat in for Iggy Pop on Pop’s BBC 6 Music show.
When you listen to ‘TTYL’, it’s easy to see why the song was so quickly picked up by the alt music scene’s cultural curators. ‘TTYL’ sounds like the sun setting, its lo-fi, analogue air giving it a nostalgic warmth, an old, frayed-VHS charm...

“There are a lot of instances of finishing each other's sentences or those unspoken things,” explains Chill. “Right now, music is the vessel we’re using to advance the message of inspiration, motivation, healing and upliftment,” adds Donn T. “But, at the core, that’s who we both are. So, it’s not surprising for us to have some kind of community service initiative or social justice effort connected to our shows or the music, something or other that we’re a part of, that helps make our surroundings, the world or maybe just one person’s life, better.

Geist’s ‘Sonic Robots’ push the boundaries of the imaginable and invent a new plurality in music creation. In electronic music, many imagine humans playing machines. Few imagined these music machines being actual robots. In 2012, Geist ventured into this exploration with the invention of his well-known oversized MR-808 robot. Now, he goes even further to pioneer the unknown and futuristic sound world of ‘Robotic Electronic Music’.
In this quest, Geist teamed up with the Berliner sound alchemists ‘Mouse On Mars‘ to dig deep into the history of mechanical music and experiments of early electronic music. In 2018 he releases the first ever techno record made with only robots on his Label SRR with help from KOMPAKT.

On their sophomore album, The Garner Poems, the group traffics their signature gritty strain of DIY Afrofuturist soul music, balancing hip-hop production techniques with lo-fi experimentation to create a sonic suite that eulogizes victims of police brutality, including Tamir Rice and Eric Garner, as well as bringing forth a conversation that aligns with the political and emotional state of this world. The Garner Poems are modern day spirituals of reverence and despair that serve as both a force of light and a schematic for hope, survival, and independence.

1181,Moving Panoramas,"Spacey but not alienating, loud yet still light, painting panoramic sound against a moving melodic backdrop, Moving Panoramas make dream rock from Austin, Texas. 
It all began in Brooklyn, where songwriter Leslie Sisson lived for nearly a decade while playing in a number of touring bands. She came back to her home state of Texas to be near her family while navigating through a series of life-changing events. This led to an array of songs that shaped the birth of the band. The debut LP 'One' released via Modern Outsider Records in 2015 conjured a wave of dream gaze and international acclaim.
Moving Panoramas break the shell of 'One' veritably 'In Two' with the new sophomore LP available via Modern Outsider 2/22/19, expanding room for more diversity, rhythm, volume, instrumentation such as the swimmy pedal steel, plus special guests Matthew Caws of Nada Surf & Sabrina Ellis of A Giant Dog/Sweet Spirit. Over the years, the band's lineup featured a moving cast of magical busy talent but has luckily landed on the incredibly solid current Baby Blues crew with Cara Tillman, Rosie Castoe, Jordan Rivell, Jody Suarez, & Phil McJunkins.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.",Rock,Psychedelic,"Austin, TX",http://audio.sxsw.com/2019/mp3_by_artist_id/cd3a476cea52203c18614e6b4016b8f528336bff56f6bad02fbdebb8736e02b6.mp3,Moving Panoramas at Empire Garage,"Mar 11, 2019",9:30pm-10:10pm,Empire Garage

1187,Mr. Wired Up,"Mr. Wired Up gets clubs fired up and parties “turned up” when he gets on the mic. The lyricist born Kerry Howard has a flow with a cadence influenced by some of Houston’s finest rappers. But his flow possesses a unique crossover appeal that geography or hip hop just can’t contain.
Groomed during an era when R&B, jazz, and soul birthed Southern rap, Mr. Wired Up can thank Houston’s bourgeoning 1990s hip-hop scene as an accelerant for his ambition to stand among the greatest MCs in the game.
Mr. Wired Up made an instant mark on H-Town’s rap scene when his classic “Put It In The Air,” featuring Yung Joc hit the airwaves and became an instant club banger. He’s produced some of the hottest underground mixtapes and collaborations with artists such as Trae Tha Truth and Fat Pimp. His mixtape, Inside My Mind, was a nominated for Mixtape of the Year by Houston Press.
“I came from an era of originality, I can slay a variety of tracks,” said Mr. Wired Up. “I’m not a one-dimensional Houston rapper. I don’t do boxes. I can’t be fit in one.” 
Now Mr. Wired Up is pushing his single Walked In and work with OGXchange.

Not in vain they have been the only Peruvian band to share stage with international bands bands such as Mac DeMarco (Canada), Catfish (France), El Último Vecino (Spain) and Cali y el Dandee (Colombia).

1191,MUNYA,"Born in the small town of Saguenay in Quebec, Josie Boivin is the youngest of nine children. Classically trained as a pianist, Boivin discovered she could sing opera in high school, when she was overheard by a music teacher while jokingly imitating an opera singer. After spending her teens in the highly competitive opera world, she studied jazz at the University of Montreal. 
It wasn’t until September of 2017 that Boivin found her calling, when a friend invited her to play the legendary Pop Montreal festival. At that point, she only had one finished song. “I realized that this was my chance,” she says. “If I was ever going to make my own music, it was now. I quit my job and moved in with my sister, just so I could write all day.”
After her sister would leave for work every day, Boivin set up her gear, transforming the kitchen into a recording studio, where she wrote and recorded, cleaning everything up before her sister got home at five. These recordings, coupled with a few in-studio days with Miles Dupire-Gagnon and Gabriel Lambert from Anemone, would eventually become her debut EP

Whether it was the instances of poetic wordplay over classic instrumentals that benchmark groups like The Roots consistently put on display, or the grungy street lyricism that flooded the same rap DVD cypher scene where artists like Meek Mill were born, Mus had developed an ear. An ear that could stand different types of crowds. An ear that was not objective, but subjective. An ear that is more common in today’s music. An ear that was open to all realms of music. As tactical as they are near genius with timing on each release, Mus Matos and his team ensure every drop entices both new and returning listeners. Subsequently, Mus has been able to amass over 2 Million plays from only ten releases and has performed alongside artists such as: The Dream, PNB Rock, Mesago, Cousin Stizz, Jourdan Banks, Dougie F, and Maxo Kream.

Mystery Lights under assorted monikers since their teens. In a heroic jump from
the small town of Salinas, California to NYC, the band solidified its lineup to now
include Alex Amini on bass, and Zach Butler on drums.
The explosive live shows gradually became the stuff of legend, as the quintet
won their following one fan at a time in dives from Brooklyn to the Bowery.
Organically unfolding over the nights months and years, the Lights’ sound has
evolved into a fuzz-fueled hopped-up 21st Century take on 60s garage pebbles,
and artful 70s punk, that is all their own. 
When Daptone Records launched their Wick Records rock imprint, they wasted
no time approaching The Mystery Lights as their inaugural act. After Wick officially 
released The Mystery Lights’ debut LP, recorded at Daptone Records’ House of 
Soul studio, they’ve been on the road ever since. 
2018 finds these Rock’n’Roll knights globe hopping from continent to continent teasing 
their highly anticipated sophomore LP ' Too Much Tension ' which is expected to land in Spring 2019.

Coming up through rap from a foray in punk with a modus operandi of “I Am What I Do, And I Do What I Want”, her work is a simultaneously supercharged and burnt out display of anti-authoritarianism, endless highs and chaotic heartbreak; a thorny yet ecstatic experience on unoccupied territory.

1207,Nancy,"The enigmatic songwriter was raised in subdued North East England and not unlike many others, Nancy dressed & acted in ways that seemed out-of-the-ordinary. Combined with his then-unhelpful androgynous and abnormal physical features, “Nancy” was both a punchline &label throughout the songwriter’s formative years. 
Beginning as a form of escapism a pop music  obsession began. It’s these past lives & vivid influences that are reimagined and  regurgitated into debut  Mysterious  Visions.
Within 8 weeks in the real world, Nancy has been been described as a musical auteur, a surrealist king, a mysterious newcomer, a provocateur, both male and female, a necromancer, in the same sentence both classy and trashy, weird and wonderful.
Recorded, produced, art-directed by Nancy the none-the-same 7-songs-long ‘EP’ is  proof of concept. An explosive kaleidoscopic vision of theatricality, romance and melancholy, a  cocktail of sassy lo-fi cabaret and art-dream-pop with contemporary deformities, a Sgt. Peppers-for-degenerates body of work to get lost in; best understood with a front-to-back listen. 
Like cigarettes, its highly addictive and probably bad for you.

Nanook of the North are Mute Song / Important Records artist Stefan Wesołowski (violin & piano) and Piotr Kaliński (synths) - two acclaimed avangarde musicians from Poland. 
Upon being invited by the Sopot Film Festival to perform an improvised score to a film screening, the duo chose Robert J. Flaherty’s classic 1922 silent movie of the same name - ‘Nanook of the North’. Keen to maintain and nurture the initial ambient essence of the film, the duo travelled to Iceland where they recorded the album at Ólafur Arnalds' studio in Reykjavík and later finished in Greenland. 
About Stefan Wesołowski:
“Awe-inspiring music that soars through dread, sorrow, joy and every emotion in between. A stunning and poignant inward journey.” XLR8R
About Piotr Kaliński:
“An underground hero amongst an intricate scene. A musician with fine tact and attention to detail, pared back to its barest essentials.” The Ransom Note

Paste Magazine heralded them as one of NYC’s must know bands of 2018. Their debut EP, Songs Born From Love and Hate dropped in November 2017 via PaperCup Music/Buen Dia Records. Remezcla called it “rock, with plenty of melody and attitude, resulting in a collision of classic CBGBs punk, and power pop melodies.” Native Sun reflects the sound of immigrant America, as noted by Noisey. 
Frontman Danny Gomez met lead guitarist Jake Pflum as a kid in Florida. Life led them apart and reunited them on a random evening in the city. They rekindled their friendship over their mutual obsession with The Rolling Stones, VU, T. Rex, Neil Young, etc. Immediately, they forced their best friend Alexis Castro to pick up the drum sticks. Bassist Mo Martinez came to them at the height of 2016’s turmoil after uprooting from Monterrey, Mexico and naturally completed the band’s lineup.

Following the release of his last EP ‘Drivers’ in 2016, Nick took a step back and submerged himself in his music in order to discover what he originally wanted to say as an artist and making sure that was present in his art moving forward.
Nick reemerged in 2018 with a newly reimagined sound established by the release of his two, psychedelic new singles “Ticking” and “Lemons” off his forthcoming project due out in 2019.
Music being at the fusion of his classical piano skill, Nick brings forth a distinct knack for crafting romantic, evocative records filled with sonic texture and color. Throughout his two previous EP’s, numerous Hype Machine #1 singles, viral secret side projects and production/writing credits for artists across multiple genres on major labels, Nick’s sound is both undoubtedly one of a kind, and instantly recognizable.

1229,Nicotine,"There’s a lot to say about vulnerability.
The way that we fear how people will see us if we show them. The way we can’t stand to look deep inside if it means we’re to face the demons we’ve buried. Sometimes we write and write and write and nothing comes out but sometimes - just sometimes - we write and something beautiful happens. 
Nicotine rose from the stories that Brianna Zepeda had yet to tell. The ones that kept her up at night, the ones that haunted her like the broken record memories that we ignore until they come out in fits of passion. With those stories, An Open Letter was born.

1230,Night Glitter,"""Five years after relocating to Austin, Loulou Ghelichkhani ( Thievery Corporation) chose to hang her hat. In part, because the music scene proved less rigid than longtime home Washington, D.C. Momentum is building for  the cinematic dream-pop prism known as Night Glitter. The band is co-anchored by singer/multi-instrumentalist John Michael Schoepf and secret weapon Jonas Wilson. They turned ears with the Adrian Quesada-produced ""Tunnels""/""Radio"" cassette, a fetching psych-pop double A-side single. 
Now, the group casts forth a deeper listen via Hangin' on a Dream, the five-track effort unfolds with Ghelichkhani's brokenhearted ""Believe,"" which sounds like Mazzy Star on a lunar mission. An omnipresent force in Austin music – backing giants in the Austin Music Awards and All-ATX house bands, and playing bass for the Happen-ins, Roky Erickson, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Bruce Robison, and Kelly Willis – Schoepf steps up to the mic on the title track and highlight ""Hangin' on a Dream"" which positions him as a shoegazy singer and impressive songwriter. The sonically rich collection may be Austin's most headphones-mandatory release of 2018."" (AustinChronicle)

1231,The Night Thief,"Despite their fear-inducing moniker burgeoning LA dance-rock exponents The Night Thief are here to give in to the night, not to take, offering a whole new sensory experience with one foot placed in the past and the other firmly in the future.
Revolving around the core nucleus of Bradley Register and Joshua Jacober, The Night Thief story is a classic narrative rife with unquenchable artistic dreams, undeniable chemistry and, most importantly of all, unique and imperative music.
Their music captures the innocence, naiveté and purity of ‘80s pop-electronica mixed with the primal energy of that same decade’s post-punk, masked with the sophistication of modern production into one seamless whole where the synthetic and organic merge into a pulsing vista of constant liquid motion.

As it transpires the present is the time when you can finally let go of the past because the future is now, and the future is The Night Thief.

For every bolt of raw noise, there’s a sugar coating. The band test the resolve of post-punk, drone and shoegaze, but the end result is a dazzling meeting ground between concrete and candy.

Asked about her debut album, Norma describes it as an introspective and stubborn quest, a lonely and passionate one, through feminine desire and the struggle for self-acceptance – her own Film Noir, and she's the Fatale heroine. 
	Nodding with great sensitivity and playfulness to the sounds of the '90s and '00s, along with a rich musical education (The Beatles and Elvis Costello at her mom's, Marvin Gaye and Gram Parsons, then later on Fiona Apple, Joni Mitchell, Kate Bush), Norma never appears twice the same way. Heady melodies, twisted harmonies, and her own dark groove, velvet vocals and intimate lyrics give the record a timeless unique style, shifting from dark trip-hop to witty RnB, from bestial house to the final country ballad. 
	A fiery, independent artist who never shies away from murky waters, Norma takes her time, without concessions. She's releasing her first album “Female Jungle”, co-produced with artist Ryder The Eagle, on her own label Shortcuts.

DOMENIC PALERMO
BRANDON SETTA
KYLE KIMBALL
AARON HEARD
Their latest LP, 'Dance On The Blacktop,' pulls from all corners of life in its contents. Stories of self loathing, self destruction, and a general disdain for humanity and its, ""insignificant"" role in Palermo's vision of the universe are met with his poised amusement and tranquil hysteria being one himself. All of this told through the eyes of a recently diagnosed Palermo suggesting he is dealing with the early stages of CTE, a neurodegenerative disease found in people with serious head injuries. Palermo spews songs of heightened confusion, anxiety, paranoia, depression, and chronic battles with physical pain- a result of his unstable past and more recent illness. These themes, spoken in a lush angelic language are juxtaposed against the band's now signature apocalyptic, reverberating wall of shimmering sound.
NOTHING sought out celebrated producer John Agnello (Dinosaur Jr, Breeders, Sonic Youth, Kurt Vile) to help accentuate the band's love for all sounds 90s, from rock to shoegaze to pop realms and on both sides of the pond.

1253,Novo Amor,"Hailing from deep in the Welsh mountains, Novo Amor is the alias of Welsh multi-instrumentalist, songwriter and producer Ali Lacey. His emotive vocals and the sounds he uses, often formed through sonic experimentation, make for fantastically atmospheric songs that are both moving and striking.
Lacey dismisses his early musical efforts as painfully emo, but in 2013 he volunteered to write the score for a friend’s feature film. For the climactic scene he wrote a song he called From Gold. “What I liked about it was that the whole song was one crescendo,” he explains. ""Though it’s just four chords repeated over again for three and a half minutes, it’s the simplest thing, and simplicity is key sometimes.”
‘From Gold’ unlocked something in Lacey. Singles Faux and Alps, both collaborations with friend and artist Ed Tullett. These were followed by a second solo EP, Bathing Beach. In November 2017 he released a full-length collaborative album with Ed Tullett, Heiress. His debut album Birthplace was released on October 19th 2018, via the AllPoints label.

1257,Numb.er,"Numb.er (pronounced nuhm-er) is the sonic brainchild of photographer and visual artist Jeff Fribourg. With a background in graphic design, Fribourg imbues his work with a sense of architectural composition, layering angular guitar riffs and analog synths over throbbing drums and driving bass. 
Fribourg developed his love affair with synthesizers -- and his open-minded approach to music -- as a founding member of LA psych-kraut favorites Froth. However, it was only with the creation of Numb.er that he was able to fully explore his eclectic musical inclinations. Combining elements of punk, shoegaze and post-punk, the project never commits to a singular worldview, allowing Fribourg’s vision to go anywhere without sounding ironic or forced.
With the release of Goodbye, the band’s first LP, Numb.er offers a genre-defying sonic document that finds them maximizing the creative potential of the studio while always remaining true to their dynamic and arresting live sound. Mixed and mastered by Mikey Young of Total Control, Goodbye is a tightly crafted debut from one of Los Angeles’ most exciting new bands.

1261,Odette,"Captivating in presence, Odette’s songs are deeply personal and see her flutter from spoken word into warm, soulful vocals, with arrangements circling soul, jazz and pop.
Born in England and raised in the inner western suburbs of Sydney, Odette grew up with an eclectic musical palette. Her South African mother introduced her to African music, soul, funk and rhythm; while her English father, hailing from a long line of jazz pianists, introduced her to new wave, jazz and passed on his musical talents.
Odette has played piano since she was a child and her highly emotive use of the instrument lives at the centre of her songs, a grounding motif of her heritage.

1266,Oh Pep!,"Since breaking through the hemispherical sound barrier, Australia’s Oh Pep! have become many things to many people. The duo’s kinship is palpable not just in the way they relate virtuosically, but in the stories they conjure together and the ways they emote them to the audience.
Oh Pep! released their second full-length, I Wasn’t Only Thinking About You...(Oct 26 on ATO/People Speak Records)— have always been as driven as they have been wildly creative. The duo met almost a decade ago, while attending a performing arts high school in Melbourne and it was fateful. 
They wrapped up touring their debut album ‘Stadium Cake’ at Glastonbury in 2017. That year they had shared stages with heroes like Billy Bragg, Lake Street Dive, Martha Wainwright, Valerie June and the Mountain Goats. NPR enthused that they were “thoughtful, deep, funny, and poetic.” The New York Times marveled at how adept they were at “sharing a melody that’s both angular and affectionate.” 
Now with their sophomore, Oh Pep! explore the melody-rich expanse between indie pop and alt-folk, while dipping into themes of growing older, and seeing the world.

1267,"Oh, Rose","“Olympia’s Oh, Rose has quietly become one of the best pop bands in the Pacific Northwest’s DIY scene, largely due to frontwoman Olivia Rose’s versatile vocals.”

Ever heard of the band KISS? How about Joni Mitchell? Ever been walking down a street and you pass by a neighbors rose garden and one reminds you of someone? So you reach out to pick it. But someone is screaming at you to get off their damn lawn so now you’re pulling, and the thorns are digging into your skin but the bloom is beautiful and who was it for, who was it for?
In the four years since forming, Oh, Rose has toured the US four times, and provided support for both Future Islands and Reptar on the west coast. Their most recent release, Seven, garnered write-ups in Gold Flake Paint, Portland Mercury and Bandcamp Daily while their debut EP, That Do Now See, was praised in blogs The Needle Drop and Nerdist.  Their new album, While My Father Sleeps, will be out in 2019.

His group Oh Sees (aka Thee Oh Sees, OCS, The Oh Sees, etc) have transmogrified to fit many a moment – from hushed druggy folk to groovy demonic pop chants to science fictional krautrock expanse and beyond – to suit his omnivorous whims. It’s common knowledge however, that at their shows, you’re there asking for a beating. 20 years going and the shows keep getting more and more intense, as many a soupy swarm can attest. The locked-in Rincon/Quattrone drum cops propel masses of strangers to froth and lean into each other as the insistent and repetitive underpinning tumbles nimbly from Tim Hellman’s bass. Meanwhile John ricochets breathy yips and snippets of synth and all manner of guitar heroics around your brain canyons while your reptile instincts yell “move”. Brain-stem body rock meets cerebral expanses, and their now du jour prolifically feeds a labyrinthine garden of well-hewn tunes.

1269,Ohtis,"The beautifully dark country-Americana and lyrical onslaught of 'Runnin' is a fitting introduction to songwriter Sam Swinson's autobiographical journey through indoctrination and addiction; an endlessly inviting confession from his past battles with substance abuse, and the religious demons lingering from his upbringing in a fundamentalist evangelical cult.
Ohtis originally formed when Swinson and co-founder Adam Pressley were at high school in Normal, Illinois. They self-released their first material on small run CD-Rs while still teenagers. 
By 2009, Swinson's addiction became life-threatening. Pressley and pedel steel player Nate Hahn had to distance themselves and the band dissolved. They kept in touch whilst living in different parts of the country, swapping ideas and songs online, never planning to release them, in equal parts because of their traumatic falling-out, and Sam's ongoing addiction to heroin.
Redemption eventually came in the form of sobriety for Swinson. After making 9th step amends to both of his re-joining bandmates, they brought Ohtis back to life.

1271,Oliver Rajamani," Critics distinguish Rajamani for having redefined Romani music-more commonly known as Gypsy music-by taking it back to its ancient roots in India as well as blending Indian folk and Romani music with Texas traditions. 
An Austin World Music award winner, a nominee of the 2008 US Artist Award and the 2014 nominee of the prestigious German world music award in the European Charts, Rajamani has toured internationally and has recorded and performed with artists wide-ranging in style including Gypsy Kings, Willie Nelson, Edie Brickell, L. Shanker, Eric Johnson, Paravai Munniamma, Dotschy Reinhardt from the Django Reinhardt family, Jeronimo Maya, Ustad Aashish Khan, Ustad Shujat Khan, Tomasa la Macanita. He has been a featured artist on the NPR BBC radio amongst numerous other radio, TV stations and magazines.
Rajamani's unique musical sound and original compositions are drawn from the historic 'Romani trail' and the lonestar state of Texas. From India's melismatic folk and spiritual chants, strings and drumming, the raw Arabic tones of the oud, the spirited torch of traditional Gypsy flamenco, to the lonestar country and blues of Texas.

His parents moved to the US to give their kids a better life and the opportunity to go to college; however, Omar always knew this route wasn’t meant for him. He began playing guitar at 12 years old, but quit soon after because he got bored of only playing in church. At age 18, Omar began listening to new styles of music and fell in love with the guitar again. His biggest influences are Benny Sings, D'angelo, Los Panchos, John Mayer, Elliott Smith, Cuco Sánchez, Paul Simon, Gary Numan, and João Gilberto. Omar released his debut EP, STEREO, this past summer and followed it up recently with a single called Today featuring producer/songwriter Teo Halm.

1278,The Ophelias,"Through a blend of understated rock, baroque pop and wide-skied atmospheres, The Ophelias explore the juxtapositions of youth in their album Almost.
Having formed the band while still in high school, the members first met at a time when each were independently serving as the “token girl” in various dude-bands from their hometown of Cincinnati, OH.
Coming from varied musical backgrounds (ranging from garage-rock, to surf, to opera), the distinct talents and influences of each member collided in unexpected ways at the band’s first rehearsal. It was here the band discovered that their chemistry wasn’t rooted in a shared musical reference point, but in the creative relief from the expected censorship of being a sideperson.
​Produced by Yoni Wolf (WHY?), the new album Almost glides between palatial assuredness and pallid introspection, looking back on youthful yearning—the uncertainties, the traumas, the anxieties—without discounting its soft beauty. 
The Ophelias steer Almost through the lineage of coming-of-age confessionals, and affectionately document their growth into a warm, fractured adulthood.

1280,Orchards,"Things are most certainly on the up for Brighton-based alt-pop quartet ORCHARDS. For anyone who might be wondering why, there’s one word that seems oddly lacking in the description of many bands, but sticks to Orchards like glue: Fun. Charming, delirious, positive, big-beaming-grin-on-your-face bundles of fun. 
Previously described as a “glittery gateway drug” and combining left-field experimentation with startlingly prescient pop sensibilities, Orchards are following in the footsteps of luminaries Everything Everything and Foals.
Approaching their new material with a heavy focus on killer melodies, the song writing process was intentionally conscious of that vital room being left for the melody to breathe, whether that meant taming a guitar riff or simplifying a drum beat, it didn’t matter so long as the melody was at the forefront.
These tracks have seen keen support from local and national radio at BBC Introducing, Juice Radio and BBC Radio 6 Music, backed up by critical praise from press including Noisey, The Line of Best Fit, DIY, CLASH, DORK, Wonderland, Indie Shuffle and a whole host of Hype Machine blogs and influencers.

Ori Alboher , is a multi-instrumentalist creator that has been making music from his home studio under the name ORI since 2012.
Inspired by R&B, Pop, Ambient and Soul, ORI shares his music with a soft voice, manipulated vocals, loops and beats - building up melodic, rhythmic and repetitive structures that pulls the listener into the music while forming moods oscillating between intimacy and distant depths.
ORI floods the listener with strong currents and powerful spells. ORI’s style could best be described as ‘Heartcore’.
“The Song ‘Solo’ By ORI from his latest album ‘1986’ was sampled by Jay Rock on his song ‘For What It’s Worth’ from his new album ‘Redemption’, the sample serves as the chorus of the song and features ORI singing “Is It Worth It, Maybe When You Go Home, I Don’t Want To Be Here, Try Not To Think About It”
The sample was picked by Kendrick Lamar (Who curated the album) & Producer Sounwave (Who produced the song).
ORI released his latest album ‘1986’ in November of 2017 and has been touring with it since. ORI is now working on his next (3rd) album to be released in 2019.

Øyvind Blomstrøm and Chris Holm mainly make a living out of being on the road with other bands, and they’re almost always traveling from town to town, country to country. When their roads crossed for the umpteenth time in 2016, their mutual dream of starting an instrumental project was finally underway. Holm’s companion from the Bergen scene, Kim Åge Furuhaug, wanted to join in on the fun, and then Orions Belte was born. 
Their debut album «Mint» is founded on old traditions but still feels new, and you’ll have to look for a long time to find anything like it. Texas band Khruangbin may be the best comparison as per today, but Orions Belte really belongs in their own galaxy. A galaxy where they are the soundtrack to movies that haven’t been made yet.

1290,Otis the Destroyer,"Riding the fuzz-fueled wave of momentum generated by 2017 debut full-length Keep Bashing, Austin rock quartet Otis the Destroyer’s sonic assault swells to a veritable tsunami on the Cool Evil EP (self-released April 12).

Lead single “Red Witch” reveals Taylor Wilkins (vocals, guitar), Clellan Hyatt (drums), Anthony Rucci (guitar), and Andrew Dalton (bass) reveling in the earworms of previous releases while assuming a newfound yet no less raucous approach to experimentation which permeates the record’s five tracks.

Make no mistake: the band’s love affair with fuzz is far from over. In fact, it’s rekindled riotously by flirtations with super-charged shoegaze (“Cool Evil Part 1”), forays into reverb-washed rollick recalling My Bloody Valentine’s wall-of-sound wallop (“Cool Evil Part 2”), and searing solos inspired by ‘90s titans like Smashing Pumpkins paired with Fugazi-inspired punk-rock punch (“Maybe I Don’t Like Drugs”). Each song embodies an urgent release of rage directed toward the evil of entitlement

In late 2017, she joined force with Montreal-based singer-songwriter Mind Bath and dropped a surprise self-titled EP. The Ouri / Mind Bath EP features both tenderness and aggressiveness, and balances the femininity and masculinity of the two artists.

He learned to play the piano and the guitar on his own and began to use his voice through his school life in Bogotá, Colombia. That’s why it was natural for him to pursue an Audio Production and Engineering degree in the Miami International University of Art & Design after he graduated high school. His work led him to stand out and be awarded with the best student in his program. Living in Miami taught him the art of songwriting. Today, years after, he has more than 100 finished songs and a catalogue that keeps growing constantly. His project officially began when he released his first single “Fue Tan Solo Un Beso” (2014), which made the top charts in Colombia for more than 3 months. He then continued to increase his fan base by performing live in different cities and festivals, and was able to start his own YouTube channel in which he uploads high quality content that has over 14.000.000 views. Pablo released his EP “Mi Media Mitad” in 2018 and began working on his first LP under Alan Saucedo’s production in Mexico City.

In his early teens, Pablo focused on finding his voice and experimented with a number of musical styles. He continued with a string of one-off record releases in the years to follow. He also earned production credits in collaboration with artists like Erykah Badu, ASAP Rocky, OG Maco, D.R.A.M., and Brent Faiyaz. Pablo soon grew disillusioned with the highly-influenced process of creating music simply with focus on sales projections instead of artistic integrity. So, he took a break from releasing music, locked himself in the studio and thus began his journey into a new-found sound.
In 2018, Pablo returned with a slew of new musical releases, which prove that he has discovered his own unique sound born from experimental ambient and classical music. On his forthcoming EP, entitled ‘The
Finest Somersault,’ Pablo introduces an introspective and luminous rock/alternative sound. Born out of
experimentation, the project is layered with dark, moody sounds, he

They honed their sound in basements across the Hudson valley, and quickly gained a reputation for their brazen and feverish live shows. Through prolific touring and recording, they have developed a dedicated nation-wide following without the aid of a major label. In their formative years, Palberta’s live performances often involved moments of synchronized dancing and humorous performance art in between songs or during them. Over the course of the last 5 years, they have developed a reputation as a “must-see” live band on the DIY circuit, honing in on a distinct and arresting sound incorporating gorgeous three part harmonies into their chaotic grooves. Roach Goin' Down is Palberta's most impressive album to date. 22 tracks combine the band's signature frenetic instrumentation with a thoroughly developed pop sensibility that was a mere glimpse on previous releases. The songs are lovingly crafted and shine with the confidence of a band discovering new musical possibilities and having a blast doing it.

After the release of the two singles, comparisons to the jangly guitar riffs of The Smiths were quickly made. In November of 2017, the group released the EP ""For The Ones Who Love You."" After being inspired by the 1981 single ""Primary"" by The Cure (where Gallup and Smith were both playing bass), two bass guitars became a prominent feature of the EP. After being inspired by self-produced acts in the 1980s (The Cleaners From Venus, The Hit Parade, etc.), The Pantones decided to self-record and release two new singles in September of 2018.

1309,Parker Gispert,"Parker Gispert Sunlight Tonight 
Parker Gispert was still in college when he helped form the Whigs in the early 2000s. But after five critically-acclaimed albums, hundreds of tour dates all over the world with the likes of Kings of Leon, Drive-By Truckers, the Black Keys and many others, and television appearances everywhere from the Late Show with David Letterman to Jimmy Kimmel Live! , the Athens, Georgia-bred rockers decided to pull back on activity in 2017. 
Which left Gispert, who had spent the majority of his adult life either in the studio or on the road with the band, at a crossroads. 
“It occurred to me that if I wanted to record and tour that I was going to need to do it solo,” the singer, songwriter and guitarist says. “I'd always thought about it in the back of my mind as something that I wanted to do one day, but ‘one day’ had never really come.” 
Now, ‘one day’ is here in the form of Sunlight Tonight , Gispert’s debut solo album (produced and mixed by Emery Dobyns). The eight-song effort finds Gispert, known for leading the Whigs through raw and jangly southern-garage rave-ups, taking a decidedly different musical approach—biting electric guitar riffs are cast out in

Formed by Christina Hansen Appel (vocals, keys) and Gonzalo Guerrero (guitar) in Santiago, Chile in 2013, the duo relocated to Brooklyn, NY and quickly began making strides amassing more than half a million streams on Spotify.
This time would go on to inspire the material that now comprises Parrot Dream’s debut full-length, Light Goes. Signing to Good Eye Records, the LP will see release digitally and on vinyl, including a limited Blood Red color run, on August 24th, 2018.
The album was written over a span of two years and touches on themes of connection, love, memories and clarity. The driving title track immediately pulls you into the lush world of Light Goes as Appel’s hypnotic synths and wistful vocals meet Guerrero’s incendiary guitars sparking a fire that burns throughout the LP. Oscillating between uplifting and elegiac, Parrot Dream draw you in to wade in deep, kaleidoscopic pools of sound as they build up towering, crystalline crescendos.

Being the first Norwegian rapper ever to be featured on Beats 1 Radio, Pasha continues to pave the way internationally for Norwegian hip hop - proving something that most thought was impossible.
Looking back, Pasha played 40 shows across Northern Europe following his album ""PARK."", had several tracks charting on radio and was highlighted by leading taste makers such as NME,  Highsnobiety, Clash Magazine and Rap Nation for spearheading the Scandinavian hip hop scene.

Like many groups before them, Brian Davis (synth, producer), Mia Carruthers (vocalist, writer) and Benjamin Hines (writer, guitarist) met in playing in a different band in 2014.
When that band fizzled out in 2016, they remained close friends and began to collaborate on songs from the ground up, a process they had never explored in their previous, more traditional group.
The combination of their diverse musical backgrounds and sensibilities allowed them each to be challenged in new ways, as they wrote, produced and recorded together resulting an exciting and empowering collection of songs. 
The group made its debut with “On the Run,” a collaboration and feature performance with L.A. Electronic/Dance producer/DJ/artist NGHTMRE from his latest EP for Mad Decent, the label founded by Diplo. In 2019, they will release a series of singles leading to their debut EP released by Modern Outsider.

On her debut album ABYSS, the Austin-based artist laces elements of dream-pop, post-punk, and electronica to create sounds that can only be described as otherworldly. Ethereal vocals glide over chilly synth hooks and thumping drum beats, creating tracks so infectious, they can lure even the most brooding shoegazers onto the dance floor.

Moving to Austin, opened a whole new world. Said Byrne, “I’ve never felt so alive musically. Every night I go see a gig; and I’m blown away. I get opportunities to play with those people, and it’s inspiring.” 
Pat recently released his new LP, “Rituals”. The artistic growth is clear; the authenticity is palpable. No one genre dictates the mix—and the tracks get better with each listening.
“The results—Irish Americana, by turns rollicking and resonating, that’s driven by his gruff growl of a voice—suggest that he’s one to keep an eye on.” Stuart Munro, The Boston Globe
“The raspy melodic soul of Byrne’s voice recalls the emotional spells the late Austin troubadour Jimmy LaFave used to cast, though Byrne’s songwriting bears a distinctive Irish stamp. He’s more contemporary than strict traditionalists, putting him more in the league of Glen Hansard or Luka Bloom, perhaps; yet at times he conjures a deeply old-school feel,” Peter Blackstock, Austin American Statesman

Young Narrator in the Breakers, Eliza’s effervescent soprano was compared to ""a lovelorn
alien reaching out from the farthest reaches of the galaxy"" (Pitchfork), and the elegant,
symphonic arrangements were described as ""weightless pop that sounds like it was beamed
down from a glimmering utopian future"" (Stereogum).
Their journey began at Yale University, where the duo both studied music – they met
playing in the same string quartet. Since that time, Eliza and Oliver have become prolific
and vital collaborators at the intersection of classical, experimental, and pop music. As a
soprano, Eliza has worked closely on new music with Meredith Monk, Julianna Barwick,
John Zorn, Caroline Shaw, and Ben Frost. Oliver has arranged strings for tracks by the
Dirty Projectors, Helado Negro and Wet, and is a member of Kevin Morby and Vagabon’s

The band quickly made a name for themselves with their wild attitude, DIY spirit and incredible live shows. Their raw energy and intense delivery has won them fans across the UK and Europe and seen them as an in-demand warm up act for musical giants such as Garbage, The Kills and Skunk Anansie. As one live reviewer put it:
“All you can think to do is ask them out for ice cream and all they want to do is wreck your car...""
The bands’ debut LP  ‘Glitter and Spit’ released in 2018 has picked up rave reviews and has been described as ‘Full of attitude, charisma and confidence - it takes the listener on an adrenaline-charged ride.’

Despite being unknown, they were selected as the opening act for the American Indie band, DEERHOOF, and quickly became locally recognized for their talent. In fact, the name, “the perfect me” was taken from one of DEERHOOF’s songs. The group’s first album, “INTO THE HOUSE”, was released in 2017. Their music blends various styles such as black music, indie rock and jazz, and has gained the support from sophisticated music listeners. Nishimura also shares his talent as a recording engineer for local artists.

They were a group of kids who started making music together during after school sessions in the homes of their creative families, and who grew up to cultivate a sound that's as much punk as is it soul. A quintet of live music blending acoustic instrumentation with electronic inputs and different vocal styles, their outlook on life and music refuses to be boxed in. Over the years, the bandmates have ebbed and flowed, but now they've reached their final form with these five original members: Elbee Thrie on vocal duties, Aja Grant on the keys, drummer Matt Byas, guitarist Elijah Rawk, and bassist Bari Bass. Their sound is a mix of soul, R&B, funk, hip hop, jazz, pop, and everything between and beyond. It's very DIY, too. They do their own songwriting, arrangement, mixing, and production. Like their sound, they avoid being fenced into one type of performance. You might catch them on a big stage at a festival, or at a more intimate venue like the legendary Blue Note in Manhattan.

After studying classical piano for nearly a decade, Pierson pursued an interest in contemporary styles of music with the help of renowned Dallas pianist, Julie Bonk, well known in Texas for teaching the inimitable Norah Jones. Julie nurtured Pierson’s knack for performance by letting him sit in on her set breaks at a weekly Sunday gospel brunch in east Dallas’ Oak Cliff neighborhood. Julie acted as his musical mentor for nearly seven years until he moved down to Austin at the age of 18 to pursue a career in original music.
Since then, Pierson has toured all over the U.S. and internationally both as a solo artist and an organist in the up and coming Austin gospel-rock group, Dr. Joe. Pierson can be found playing all over Austin and the rest of Texas on a regular basis. His unique sound draws influence from Bill Withers, Carole King and Glen Campbell.

Together with her punk cohorts Anastasia Sanchez (vocalist/drummer, 20), guitarist Isabelle Fields (19),
and bassist Eva Chambers (19) have a clear understanding that Pinky Pinky's modus operandi is in not
overthinking their decisions. You can hear that on their debut album, 'Turkey Dinner' due on Innovative
Leisure. It follows their two prior EPs, most recently 2018's 'Hot Tears'. Their first full-length, however, is
even freer than their previous efforts. It's a patchwork quilt of garage rock and oddball indie. It's rooted in

The space obsession stems from the band's existential obsession of trying to understand what's going on here and who we are. The metaphor of the Pioneer 11 probe, this odd human creation drifting aimlessly through space, symbolizes the feeling they get when they're creating.  Only so much is in their control and oftentimes, it feels more like discovery than assembly. To them, space represents infinite possibilities, mystery, peace and fear, life and death, and embracing a world view that allows us to zoom out and view our own lives with a wider perspective.

1365,Postdata,"“‘Tis a fearful thing, to love what death can touch.”
That phrase, written by 11th century Spanish philosopher and poet Judah Halevi, reconciles two conflicting certainties: we will love, and what we love will die. We will be loved; we, too, will die. The two seem antithetical, like two sides of a coin, as if something’s worth is undermined by its mortality. But they coexist. In a certain light, they even complement one another. There is courage inherent in building a community that we will one day leave. Though we will cease to exist, the love we share is not necessarily terminal.
On Let’s Be Wilderness, his new record with revolving-door project Postdata, Paul Murphy explores both sides of that coin. The frontman of beloved Nova Scotia alternative outfit Wintersleep, Murphy has built a circle of collaborators, friends, and family around him for more than a decade. Murphy first released music with Postdata in 2010, a self-titled debut that saw him working with his brother Michael to record a set of songs that dealt with family, legacy, and connection. Now, Postdata returns with Let’s Be Wilderness, a record characterized by those two old bickering friends: love and death.

Their Sun Damage EP in 2012 and their debut LP, 2013’s Hell Bent, put them on the map, and the subsequent years of touring and an acclaimed self-titled EP in 2015 reinforced their status as one of punk’s most rock-solid and talented upstarts.
In 2016, Potty Mouth moved to Los Angeles and began working with engineer Courtney Ballard to record a stockpile of songs they had created over the years since the release of their self-titled EP. This collection of songs have come together as ""SNAFU,"" the band's sophomore album released March 1, 2019 on Get Better Records.

Songs like “She Is Waiting” prove that they’re just as comfortable launching into a heavy, alt-country breakdown as they are a world-weary lyrical stream of consciousness. The Prescriptions channel a broad range of influences, from the aching, unaffected honesty of ‘70s folk titans like Neil Young, to the guitar-driven melodies of The Strokes’ early recordings and the experimental energy of Wilco.

1371,Priests,"What is at stake? The question rattles across the second LP from Washington, D.C. rock iconoclasts Priests: The Seduction of Kansas. Seduction evokes pleasure, sex—but it can become propaganda, a tactic of manipulation, a ploy in the politics of persuasion. “There’s something sinister about the idea of seducing a whole state,” says drummer Daniele Daniele. “You’re clearly up to something. Why would you do it?” The title—like Priests—is a moving target, probing questions about the realities and mythologies of America in 2019 without prescribing easy answers. Daniele, vocalist Katie Alice Greer, and guitarist G.L. Jaguar—remain an inspired anomaly in modern music. A band on its own label, Sister Polygon Records- Priests play rock’n’roll that is as intellectually sharp as it is focused on pop’s thrilling pleasure centers, that is topical without sloganeering. The high-wire physicality of their live shows, the boldness of their Barbara Kruger-invoking visual statements, their commitment to cultural, political, and aesthetic critique—it’s all made Priests one of the most exciting bands of their generation, subversive in a literal sense, doing things you would not expect.

The wings of this retro rainbow Pegasus are Primo’s signature powerhouse vocals. She sings with urgency, from the gut, hitting notes so high you’ll wonder if she’s hiding a soprano sax in her throat. With each and every song written, produced, and recorded by Primo herself, this rock-n-roll assassin delivers the punch music fans of all genres have been oh-so-eagerly anticipating. Primo is currently hard at work on a follow-up EP to be released in the spring 2019.

1380,Proper.,"Brooklyn, NY, trio Proper., FKA Great Wight, has made a name for themselves in East Coast DIY emo punk circles and beyond with their debut album The Suburbs Have Ruined My Life.
A collection of songs originally written over several years by guitarist and vocalist Erik Garlington, the twelve-track release is given new life through bassist Natasha Johnson and drummer Elijah Watson. However, what has remained constant and is the centerpiece of Suburbs is Garlington's lyrics, which tell the story of a black and queer adolescent navigating the Bible Belt and ultimately making his way to New York. 
The band has toured throughout the U.S. as well as the UK and Europe. They have also performed on the now-defunct The Chris Gethard Show.

1383,Psychedelic Porn Crumpets,"Take the trail out of Perth via Leederville and keep on driving, and you might just stumble across an old horse shed – one where weirdness roams free. Across the bridge from said shed, house parties rage until the early hours and beyond, while around the corner there’s a sky-high pile of trash that acts as a makeshift home for the local rat population. It’s here, amongst jam sessions that would last six-hours plus, that the wacky, sprawling sound of Psychedelic Porn Crumpets was born.

“It had a tin roof, so it was really nice when it rained,” reveals the band’s frontman and ringleader Jack McEwan – an idyllic image that’s quickly scrawled over when he recounts a tale of said roof tearing off in the wind one night. “I used to have to wake up at 3am and spray myself with bug spray,” he adds with a shrug. Composing songs on an old, out-of-tune piano, and hooking up projectors to their amps to beam warped imagery around the clapped-out barn, their wonky approach to music-making took root amongst the hay. “We got too many noise complaints,” he admits, revealing that they’ve since decamped to a seaside home where they can make as much racket as they please. “It got into fine territory,

1384,Public Practice,"The four members of Public Practice—singer Sam York, guitarist Vince McClelland, synth/bassist and vocalist Drew Citron, and drummer/programmer and producer Scott Rosenthal—are no strangers to song writing. A Brooklyn DIY super group of sorts, Public Practice combines members of freshly-dead punk project WALL and local pop band Beverly. Public Practice backs their ambitious song writing with serious chops, their live shows already pulling them into the sharp foreground of a scene growing all too warm-and-fuzzy.
Sam York’s lyrics reflect the city and it’s contradictions—they are personal, funny, cryptic and surreal, but never truly pessimistic, rotating around an individual’s toxic but symbiotic relationship with perception. Songs like the sarcastically-titled “Foundation” deep-fry Beach Boys guitars in ice-cold-but-somehow-funky Scritti Politti grooves. Add a dead pan David Byrney vocal, and Public Practice remind us again how integral it is to use honesty and self-reflection to bring some of life’s double-standards to light.

1403,The Rad Trads,"The gentlemen comprising the Brooklyn-based The Rad Trads distinguish themselves in ways few bands can. Already drawing lines around the block at home, the globe-trotting group’s singular take on rock n’ roll mixes punk rock energy, horn drenched soul, and jazz precision, all with a lighthearted but sincere delivery. It’s a sound and show that is gaining steam world over as The Rad Trads continue to tour in support of On Tap, out now from Hornblow Recordings. Challenging but humorous, at times The Rad Trads bring to mind Springsteen and his “Big Man” Clarence Clemons, Dylan’s Blood On The Tracks-era vocal style, and Wilco’s epic guitar breakdowns. All of this sonic goodness is only upstaged by the fact that the guys in The Rad Trads manage to exist as five distinct songwriters and singers in a band that still sounds powerfully egoless, familial, and cohesive.

1404,Rainstorm Brother,"Rainstorm Brother is the cinematic freak-folk of John Isaac Watters and Tyler Chester:
""John Isaac Watters has long been among the most cerebral, although under-appreciated, purveyors of folk music in Los Angeles, his spare meditations fraught with the fragility of his own humanity (and yours). During his 2016 residency at the Hi Hat, Watters unveiled the new collaboration Rainstorm Brother, which finds the singer-songwriter working with keyboardist-producer Tyler Chester to achieve a sound that might be described as cinematic freak-folk … or, at least, experimental and extraordinary."" -buzzbands 
Elements like fire, smoke, water and earth fill Rainstorm Brother's music. Ever changing and infinite, they seek to describe the vast and compounded wonders of heartache and loneliness. Combining radical live instrumentation with samples-and-laptop production, tectonic plates grinding against each other in orchestrated cacophony, Rainstorm Brother's music becomes more than just something you listen to, it's a structure you interact with, a conduit that channels the depths of the hearts of its two creators.

The former was dressed as Freddie Mercury and the latter as a vacuum cleaner.

The romance wasn’t to be, but Gallimore was soon drafted into the band’s line-up. This is all fact???
What is certainly true is Betts, Sam James (guitar) and Wayne Jones (bass) met Bird and Gallimore and The Ramona Flowers were born...
Having initially banded together in their shared search to find the sweet spot between rock and electronica, The Ramona Flowers have progressed through two albums – Dismantle And Rebuild (2014) and Part Time Spies (2016) – to their finely-honed third long-player, Strangers. Their most electronic and dancefloor-ready offering to date, its creation was overseen – as was its predecessor – by American, London-based producer Chris Zane (Passion Pit, Friendly Fires, St Lucia). “Chris has a brilliant knack for getting the most beautiful sounds out of classic synths,"" Sam James says of Zane.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.",Rock,Electronic,"Bath, UK-ENGLAND",,The Ramona Flowers at Malverde,"Mar 13, 2019",11:00pm-11:40pm,Malverde

I love that – It’s what I do -- It's me telling my own story."" Goren sets his lyrics to a soundtrack of soulful hip-hop and pop/rock.

1426,Rebecca Loebe,"She calls herself a singer-songwriter, but as soon as Rebecca Loebe leans into the first notes of Give Up Your Ghosts, her first release for Blue Corn Music (Feb. 8, 2019), that definition starts to seem woefully inadequate.  Loebe is not just another talent. She’s a sophisticated, mature writer with a relevant point of view, who has earned a legion of loyal fans through a solid decade of performing. 
Her national touring career was launched by a win at the prestigious Kerrville Folk Festival songwriting competition, and her radical reinterpretation of Nirvana’s ‘Come As You Are,’ made her an instant fan favorite on the first season of The Voice on NBC.
But timing and delivery alone don’t make an artist. There’s got to be substance as well, and on her new album Loebe fearlessly probes the rawest corners of her psyche to find it. “There's a lot of me talking to myself,” she says. “I’m writing a lot of empowerment jams these days, and I think it's because it's what I need. I've written albums full of what I needed to say, but this album is full of songs I need to hear.”

1432,The Red Pears,"The Red Pears are an indie/alternative band from El Monte, CA. The band consists of Henry Vargas on guitar and vocals, Jose Corona on drums, and their good friend Patrick Juarez helping on bass. The group started in the summer of 2014, when Jose and Henry got together with talks of forming another band having known each since high school and playing in different groups, separately and together. Things took off from there as they both shared similar influences, similar backgrounds and similar mindsets and visions. 
They started as a duo, with their first gig together being an open mic at a church. The duo became a trio and started playing anything from house parties, to bars, to coffee shops, to open mics. Things started moving fast as the release of ‘We Bring Anything to the Table… Except Tables, We Can’t Bring Tables to the Table’, garnered unexpected attention. They have continued playing and noticed a growth in their audience throughout the years since. 
With a very loyal and supportive fan base, and with their latest record, ‘For Today, For Tomorrow, For What Is, For What Could’ve Been’, the group is reaching new heights and new territory.

1433,red steppes,"
A Mouth May Grow (Native Cat Recordings 2018) is the first full length album from red steppes. Helmed by songwriter and photographer Nika Aila States, recorded and mixed to tape at Tiny Telephone in Northern California, the songs are built from organic and felt performances, drawing their aesthetic language from the bounded period of long days and evenings in the studio, from the generous imitations of analog tape. Driving the album's musical exploration is a deep respect for folk music, age-old melodic traditions, and for the experimental and irreverent.
The songs saunter through mapped points on the Western coast of the US, explore growth and decay, and interrogate narrative tropes surrounding love, gender, and industry. Nika's wider artistic practice as a visual artist can't help but find its way into her musical work: a yearning for a sense of place, the positioning of botany and landscape as teacher and translator, and the pregnant silence of uninhabited places.
States currently lives in Brooklyn, where she is preparing her second full-length release, pursuing a Geography degree, and exploring a bridge between textile arts and photography.

For their powerful new album, ‘The Wanting,’ the band handed production duties over to acclaimed singer/songwriter Will Hoge, who helped them create their most ambitious, fully realized collection yet. Recorded in Nashville, TN, the record draws on many of the group’s traditional strengths—indelible melodies, infectious hooks, explosive performances—even as the making of it pushed them far outside their comfort zone and forced them to take an unprecedented, nearly year-long break from touring.
The bands most recent single “I’ve Got a Feeling it Hurts,” is a stunning, sonic duet with former tour-mate, LIZ BRASHER.

1440,*repeat repeat,"*repeat repeat was founded by Jared Corder — a former punk-rock kid raised on the sounds of Bad Religion & Black Flag. The goal was simple: to make edgy, guitar-driven music that nodded to the classic sounds of Jared's California birthplace, complete with hazy harmonies and surf-inspired arrangements. The problem? The group needed a female harmony singer, and nobody seemed to fit the bill. Things changed when the band's producer suggested that Jared's wife, Kristyn, sing with the band. The fit was natural. Kristyn had grown up in California, listening to '60s legends like the Mamas and the Papas & The Everly Brothers. She quickly completed the band, sharing vocal duties with Jared and serving as the inspiration for much of Bad Latitude — a debut album largely written by Jared during the couple's engagement.
Floral Canyon (their sophomore album) stretches the band's musical envelope, adding depth, drive, and darkness to the sun-baked, surf-tinged pop that's always been their bedrock. Gluing everything together is the band's melodic, musical attack: equal parts percussive thunder, trembling organ, synth pads, coed harmonies, and wide-ranging guitar parts.

In their first year as an active band, Reptaliens signed to Brooklyn’s Captured Tracks label and released their debut album.
Reptaliens craft a unique cast of costumed actors who accompany the band onstage with eccentric skits, bizarre imagery featuring cloaked lizard humanoids exposing conspiracy theories, religious priests, cult figures erotically dancing, and long armed aliens feeding fruit to the audience.

A string of viral singles such as 2016’s “iCarly” and “Hey Arnold” lit up the internet as her breakout mixtape Tales of Tacobella received praise from Washington Post, XXL, Pigeons & Planes, and more. Next up, the 21-year-old opened up a bold, bloody, and bright world of her own on Sugar Trap 2 accompanied by alter egos Tacobella and Trap Levine (Think Rainbow Brite participating in “Purge” night). “Poppin” appeared on HBO’s hit series “Insecure,” and she joined forces with Lil Yachty on “Mamacita” for the chart-dominating Fate of the Furious Official Soundtrack. In the aftermath, she signed to Atlantic Records.

1453,Rico Pressley,"Mike WiLL Made-it and the Ear Drummers team are introducing the label’s newest signee, Rico Pressley,​ with the
release of two strikingly diverse tracks. Hailing from Marietta, Georgia (the same hometown as Mike WiLL himself),
the 19-year old artist fits in seamlessly with the Ear Drummers’ southern-rooted roster, and sonically, he’s already
signaling his own promising trajectory. “I.F.W.I​” and “Socialite​” encapsulate the energy that Rico first revealed at this
year’s SXSW​ performance when he opened for Rae Sremmurd. “I.F.W.I” is an easy-to-digest banger with its trappy,
piano-based beat filled with gritty 808s, and in “Socialite” Pressley taps an intriguing falsetto reminiscent of Swae
Lee’s bridge from the SremmLife 2 stand-out, “Swang”. Coming on the heels of this year’s Ear Drummers releases--
Trouble’s “Edgewood” mixtape and Rae Sremmurd’s innovative three-sided album “SR3MM”-- Rico Pressley’s
signing was announced by Mike WiLL via Twitter, noting that his debut mixtape, SKIPP’N SCHOOL LIKE FERRIS, is ​
coming soon. Up until signing, Rico had amassed over 200,000 plays from a small but dedicated following on
SoundCloud.

She then released Lifted, an EP in collaboration with one of her best friends and producer Chesko.
The EP was also well-recieved by the press and public. One of the songs (Go) was featured in the tv series ""SKAM"".

1465,Robbie Fulks & Linda Gail Lewis,"Wild! Wild! Wild!, the new collaboration between Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Robbie Fulks and rock-and-roll royalty Linda Gail Lewis, gleefully lives up to its title. It’s Americana music that’s as butt-shakin’ as Beale Street, deep-rooted as the Grand Ole Opry, and hip as a trip to The Strip. Subversive as it is reverential, the album jumps the genre tracks of nitty-gritty rock-and-roll, country-and-western, rockabilly, jump swing, and gospel, landing in a strange slice of spacetime—call it 1954—when all these were One (and Linda was 7). 
Robbie Fulks, the record’s producer, is “one of the most observant and wry songwriters of the past two decades” (Rolling Stone). Ground-zero Louisiana-born rocker Linda Gail Lewis is the younger sister and frequent performing partner of Jerry Lee Lewis, whose piano innovations she carries forward. Her present-at-the-creation cred buoys the record while Robbie—who sings, plays, leads the band, writes most of the songs, and arranges the others—provides an anchoring sensibility, one that savors old sounds but sidesteps nostalgia. Their two talents have fashioned a record that’s urgent, honest, and fun. Remember fun?

Alan Aldridge, who passed away February 17, 2017, is known as “The Father of Rock And Roll Art”. His illustrations and art images are renowned worldwide. Back in 2014, Alan started working on the new album cover design as a favor to his friend, Robert Johnson – world class guitarist/producer/writer. Now, with the eminent release of the album, Johnson’s “I’m Alive” - highlighted by Alan Aldridge’s front-and-back neon illustrations - will be released on in mid-March 2019 by the southern California-based Burger Records label. Alan Aldridge’s signature also graces the back cover. “I’m Alive”, partially recorded at Abbey Road Studios, features Mick Taylor (Rolling Stones) Jimmy Davis and Jimi Jamison (Survivor). 
The Burger Records’ accompanying release #2 is in tandem with the 40th anniversary of Robert Johnson’s debut solo album “Close Personal Friend”.  Its re-release delivers a one-two album punch. The “Burger – Johnson dual release”

1474,Rod Melancon,"Like the soundtrack to a movie that doesn’t yet exist, Rod Melancon’s Pinkville whips up a world filled with shellshocked war veterans, gun-wielding rock & rollers, and other down-on-their-luck characters, mixing cinematic details and electric guitars into its own version of greasy, gothic Americana.
Pulling everything together is Melancon himself: a southern songwriter and storyteller rooted in the oral tradition of Cormac McCarthy and Larry Brown. His songs are dark and detailed, and his voice — which veers between a spoken-word delivery, a croon, and a rough-edged howl — is every bit as diverse as the material it delivers. Pinkville, his fourth release, makes plenty of room for that diversity. There are psychedelic soul songs, Rolling Stones-inspired rockers, tributes to icons like Freddy Fender and Tom Petty, and a cover of Bruce Springsteen’s “57 Channels (And Nothin’ On),” all captured in analog sound by co-producers Adrian Quesada and Will Walden.

1482,Rose Droll,"Welcome to the world of Rose Droll’s debut album, one that mystifies people trying to compare it to anything else. It challenges conventions, knocking you on your ass with some glitchy electronics here or a blown-out scream there when you least expect it. It’s a captivating listen from the San Francisco-based artist, one that rewards multiple listens and a close reading of the lyric sheet.

The resulting album, self-recorded and self-produced in a duplex in LA’s Highland Park and a quiet cabin in Big Bear, is a collection of ten diverse tracks spanning the last three years. She played every instrument on the record, including guitar, piano, drums, bass, cello, and glockenspiel.

The songs tell a meticulous and complex story, detailing the joy and despair following the inception and drawn-out end of various romantic connections and her division from Christianity. The songs all have one major thing in common: the commitment to honesty, often telling these stories exactly as they happened.

Your Dog, released on 11/16 via Father/Daughter and Double Denim, will linger in your brain for weeks, giving you a rare glimpse into the life of one of the most stunning new talents around.

Eight years later, the trio of Alex Hwang (guitar/vox), Daniel Chae (guitar/vox) and Sally Kang (keys/vox) have returned to the name - this time as the title of their upcoming EP, “Monsters Calling Home: Part One,” out in May 2019. A celebratory effort ushering in a new era for the band, after having recently evolved from a sextet to a trio, “MCH: Part One” is about finding hope in transition, discovering your voice in a sea of doubt, and deciding to dance despite sadness. Since the departure of three founding band members in 2016, Run River North have fought to reclaim their identity and their sound. With that came a reckoning: The trio were steadfast on returning to their roots and rebranding again as Monsters Calling Home as a way to separate themselves from the personnel changes.“Having to go through three breakups, it was a shitty time,” Hwang says. “The EP song are more representative of how do you find hope and how do you find joy even if you have a right to feel angry. How can you find a reason to dance even when everyone is telling you it’s not the right time to dance?”

With a support system of Atlanta music veterans, including DJ Holiday and The Commission, Richy has a solid foundation today, but this wasn’t always the case. Richy began freestyling in school at a young age, noticeably outshining the competition. “Music has always been in my blood,” he says, “but it wasn’t until later I thought about being an artist.” In his early rap career, Richy was known as Snipe in the group Murder Mafia, which later renamed to Born With It. He soon learned it wasn’t as easy as it looked. “Unfortunately, these same peers never took me serious because I was always getting locked up,” he admitted.
Being in and out of jail wiped away several prime opportunities. B.o.B. was featured on the Born Wit It record “Stack Your Paper” produced by DJ Toomp.

Incorporating dissonance into traditional song structures, Russian Baths aesthetic recalls Big Black’s caustic fits, ’70s space rock, Chapel Hill’s noise pop, Big Muff driven grunge, and the angular arrangements of British post-punk. The breadth of Russian Bath’s scope in sound is marked by the distance and cohesion between singles in the furious, driving “Slenderman” and the elegant thunderstorm that is “Poolhouse.”

Blending saxophone and thrift-store keyboards with elements of bands like The Stooges, The Fall and The Butthole Surfers, they became known for their noisy, chaotic, high-energy performances. 
When their landlord threatened eviction over “sounds of elephants stampeding through the walls,” the band moved their set out of the garage and into friends’ living rooms, crashing house parties and pushing their way through the boys’ club into the local punk scene.
The band’s first demo caught the attention of King Khan, who called them ""the best thing to happen to Texas music since the meeting of Tommy Hall and Roky Erickson” of the 13th Floor Elevators, and he invited them to cause a ruckus on his southwestern tour dates. 
After a few years of playing self-booked tours around the country, the band made its way onto the festival circuit - the most recent performance being a slot at Austin City Limits 2018. They’ve also shared stages with the likes of King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, Oh Sees, Ty Segall and more.

1498,Saint Pé,"In 2014, after 10 years of touring the world (literally every continent but Antarctica!) in Atlanta’s legendary Black Lips as well as the critically-acclaimed Diamond Rugs, guitarist and vocalist Ian Saint Pé needed a change. As he put it, “The only thing you can’t change is time, So it was time that changed me. I loved the Black Lips, but I needed to enjoy new environments. So I got a brand new bag: Saint Pé.“ 
He packed up his gear and moved to Nashville, where he settled down in a log cabin formerly owned by country legend Roy Acuff. Before long, that home had also turned into a studio, and with the help of a number of Atlanta-based friends, Fixed Focus was born. It’s less a departure from the sounds of the Lips and Rugs as it is an informed continuation of them that maintains all the hooks and pop sensibilities of his previous acts, while refining them with a bit of Nashville class and a hint of the darkness that 10 years on the road imbues upon the soul. 
From singalong stompers ”Street Lights,“ ”Got The Look“ and ”Kiss It Goodbye“ to Southern Gothic explorations like ”Burning Bright“ and ”Carbon Maker,“ Fixed Focus is a fully-formed solo debut.

1502,Sam Fender,"In the midst of a sprawl of council estates and terraced houses that snake down the high street on the way east to the Tynemouth coast, there’s a square patch of parched grass with goalposts at each end. Before his guitar offered an escape route from North Shields, Sam Fender would roll around its cracked pavements with nothing much to do and nowhere to go. Invariably, he’d be kicking a ball around or smoking cigarettes, always with a song in his head.
“I love my hometown, but when I was growing up I did feel trapped,” he begins. “I felt suffocated, it was claustrophobic.” Fender couldn’t stand the inertia, and turned to his guitar rather than his A-Levels to find a way past it. A sense of abandon informs his urgent, heartfelt, already essential rock‘n’roll songs, which tell stories of a life on the fringes.

1503,Samia,"Every song from New York City’s Samia shows a poet’s gift for capturing the most private of experiences, a gritty specificity that leaves her lyrics carved right onto your heart. Her ballads recall a low-lit charm and her rock songs rev and howl with intensity. But whether the volume is up or down, Samia draws from the same well of sharp-witted lyricism as forebears old and new —from Patti Smith to Liz Phair to Josh Tillman.
Now with her new double A-side single “Lasting Friend”/“Paris,” Samia further proves her profound skill at transforming painful or ugly or entirely ordinary moments into something transcendent. The gloriously scrappy yet strangely tender “Lasting Friend” finds Samia building an unlikely anthem out of a complicated high school memory. “I have this party anecdote about how the boys in middle school used to line up in the gym and touch my boobs,” she recalls. “It's as funny as it is difficult for me to grapple with, because it's how I learned to measure my worth. I made a lot of friends thatway and it's hard to unlearn that routine; we were all trying to make sense of the roles we were assigned.”

Using my love for music, attention to detail, and imagination, I’ve been able to create a rhythm that tells a story. Originally from San Francisco, I was raised in a Christian/Catholic household& was a firm believer, until something very big shook my faith. I was sexually abused by my father at 8 years old. After my abuse, I was silenced for 15 years by the church and my family. As a little girl, who’s father was a deacon, and primary spiritual example, my belief system crumbled under his sickness. I was left broken. Lack of support left me isolated and alone. I came to Los Angeles, hoping to pursue music, and find the courage to share my story. I moved to city of 7 million a victim, and became an advocate.

1507,San Mei,"San Mei AKA Emily Hamilton began her musical journey at the keys of her family piano, a consequence of a love ingrained and inherited from her dad’s favourite Beatles records and penchant for classic 60’s pop.
San Mei is enamored with the transportative nature of music, her guitar heavy, delay ridden, dreamy pop explores the hyper-blaze of existence and the intricacies of the in between.
Family and home have always been integral to Hamilton’s creative process. The daughter of Chinese-Malaysian and New Zealand born parents, her family immigrated to Australia at an early age. 
Her parents, resilient and sacrificial, nurtured and encouraged her creatively, instilling in her a gift that she would lean on heavily to help diffuse and navigate the chaos of growing up and forging her identity. Using art as therapy, her songs became a conduit for escape and to shoulder the loss of her mother. 
Armed with just a MIDI-keyboard and a Macbook San Mei was born. Her DIY project quickly gained groundswell and nods from national tastemakers Triple J, and further afield from heavy weights NME and NYLON.
The DNA of her creativity and pop-influencers matured, taking tips from her guitar driven he

1508,San Saba County,"San Saba County began as a straight garage-country group that could only come from Austin, Texas: equally comfortable playing the Continental Club and 30-something house parties with angular po-mo groups with Romulan haircuts.  Singer John Saba and his Dallas Jesuit high school classmate, Chris Wellington, wedded the unshakable, rhythm of Idahoans Tom Hudson and Tyler Mallory (Silver Scooter).  And, over the course of nearly a decade, the band has truly found their sound. 
This year band will release its sixth album, “Sub Rosa” (release date May 2019).  This album is forged from 1960's Texas garage-rock, cosmic-country, R.E.M, and the multitude of music that followed in their sneaker prints.  It's music for people who don't care about genres anymore, so long as the guitars are loud.
""Fifth,"" (2016) was well-received, described as “ghostly anthemic” and deserving of “the same national audience that Okkervil River and Shearwater enjoy.”  -Austin Chronicle.  
Through it all, are the songs – honest, witty, and well-crafted.  But, like the band’s predecessors, the essence will always be remembered sounding best as performed jumping off the hardwood floors of an East Austin crash pad.

1509,Sarah Bethe Nelson,"Sarah Bethe Nelson is the constant observer. Having spent the better part of her adult life tending bar at San Francisco’s most well-loved watering holes, she has witnessed thousands of late nights fights, early morning rants, blackouts, make-outs, and make-ups. Yet she seems to have an eye cast askance at the streetlights outside. For it’s not the drama unfolding inside the bar that keeps her rapt; it’s the possibility that one night a light will appear outside, a glowing orb with all the answers that she can levitate into, that will rescue her from love-worn ennui, from the violence of misspent youth. What stands out about the songs on her Burger Records debut Fast-Moving Clouds is this sense of waiting, waiting, hoping.
Ms. Nelson doesn’t exude the brassy confidence of a chanteuse; nor does she wear the mask of false naivete favored by some of her “indy” musical contemporaries. Rather, Nelson and her plaintive, unforced voice seem to hang in the balance, and the source of her songs seems a mix of genuine heartbreak and stark resolve. Her music is reflected in that not-extreme dichotomy; in it there is warmth and beauty, as well as a genuine mean streak, softened barely by her we

1510,Sarah Shook & the Disarmers,"North Carolina’s Sarah Shook sings with a conviction and hard honesty sorely lacking in much of today’s Americana landscape. Always passionate, at times profane, Sarah stalks/walks the line between vulnerable and menacing, her voice strong and uneasy, country classic but with contemporary, earthy tension. You can hear in her voice what’s she’s seen; world weary, lessons learned—or not—but always defiant. She level-steady means what she says. Writing with a blunt urgency—so refreshing these days it's almost startling—Sarah's lyrics are in turn smart, funny, mean, and above all, uncompromising. Sly turns of phrase so spot on they feel as old and true as a hymn. Anger that's as confrontational as it is concise. Humor that's as wry and resigned as a park bench prophet. 
The Disarmers hit all the sweet spots from Nashville’s Lower Broad to Bakersfield and take Sarah's unflinching tales out for some late-night kicks. At times, it’s as simple and muscular as Luther Perkins’ boom-chicka-boom, or as downtown as Johnny Thunders. The Disarmers keep in the pocket, tight and tough.

""Ok, maybe they're more like over-dramatic drafts of texts that you compose in the Notes section of your iPhone, but either way, they come from a place of getting something off my chest."" In an Instagram post announcing the release of ""Callous,"" a haunting ballad chronicling the disintegration of a relationship over wrenching guitar wails, she sums up the inspiration behind her engrossingly confessional debut more bluntly: ""Everyone I fucked and who fucked me last year.""

Lately, lots of people have been listening. In 2018 SaulPaul had 2 popular songs climb the charts and become #1 hits on Sirius XM radio. In 2019, 1 of those songs was still on the charts! 18 weeks and counting!
Those that have followed SaulPaul's career know that you never know what to expect. He headlined the Kiddie Stage both weekends at ACL. But he also officially showcased at the Folk Alliance Festival. He could drop a folk album or a trap album. (He's done both.) When asked why he is so diverse, in his southern accent he replies, ""Because that's what true to me. I'm just doing me. I'm from the trap. And I play guitar & sing. It makes sense in my mind.""
SaulPaul is unique. And his collaborations are too. He has worked with artists from around the world. His most recent collaboration is with Latin Grammy winning artist, 123 Andrés for SaulPaul’s song, Home, which is featured on SaulPaul’s album, All Star Anthems.
As the saying goes, ""He started from the bottom and now he's here."" But the question is...Where's he headed next?
Stay Tuned.

is fast establishing himself as an authentic original, Americana artist with an old soul. His deep,
beyond-his-years lyrics and melodies, raw, soulful vocals, and powerful live performances have attracted
an ever-growing number of devoted fans of all ages, selling out shows throughout the US.
As a folk/blues singer-songwriter, who cut his teeth at local farmers markets, open mics, and iconic New
York venues like Caffe Lena, the Towne Crier Cafe, and The Bitter End, Sawyer seemed an unlikely
match for reality tv, but quickly won over broad audiences with his genuine delivery and unique
arrangements of classic songs, going on to win season 8 of NBC's The Voice.
In 2018, Sawyer once again went independent, reclaiming full artistic control, creating an album entirely
written by Sawyer, self-produced and self-released. The highly-anticipated Hide Your Ghost sheds the
high gloss major label treatment, and stays true to Frederick’s honest and elegantly stripped down style, a
self-described “free range folk”, incorporating elements of blues, roots rock, and jazz.

Inspired by Drum’n’bass, House, Groove music, Trip Hop, World music, and Jazz, they spontaneously create an alchemy of digital and organic sounds and take the audience on an ever-evolving journey.  Jason improvises using mathematical functions and AI to generate lush synth harmonies layered over polyrhythmic percussion-heavy grooves. His code and data visualizations of his process are projected during the performance.
May’s voice ranges from meditative and ethereal, to deep and soulful, to jazzy and intricate. She augments her voice with digital processing, adding echoes, loops, reverbs, filters, and harmonies to her voice.  When the groove is right, she improvises entire songs from scratch, and when the music becomes complex she plays her voice like an instrumental soloist.
The duo are connected in both the digital world, as their systems share information about rhythm and harmony, and in the analog world as May improvises over Jason’s music, while he steers the algorithms to follow the path of her musical phrasing.

1526,Seán Barna,"""I'll paint my nails when it suits me / Breathtaking, isn't it, masculinity?"" -lyric from Cissy's ""Modern Man""
Employing a highly-visual lyrical panache and an atypically full-throated singing style, Barna’s newest record, Cissy, a gasping, rapid-fire deconstruction of what it means to be a man. If Bukowski was queer and wrote songs for Patti Smith, those songs might sound like this.
Camped out in 1809 Studios, a literal stone’s throw from the Erie Canal, Seán and producer/studio owner Dave Drago set out to make a record, start to finish, in a few days, later adding a collaboration from Adam Duritz of the Counting Crows.
Cissy is a measured, brutally observant deconstruction of masculinity, where the main players in the story – drag queens, mothers, queers, office workers, and wanderers – come together in the name of excess and anxiety. Barna plays both drums and guitar on Cissy, but it is his rare poetic bravado and stream-of-consciousness vocal delivery – theatrical and pained but grounded and honest – that guides us, shines a light on our traumas, and invites us in for a drink.

Sebastian has a rather uncommon approach to releasing music, putting out a new original song each week, along with a video diary narrating how each song was created and recorded. Treating music, respectfully, more as content than as a product.
His songs along with soft melodies and emotive lyrics that dance around the deep and soft tints of his voice, take you down a path to discover the emotional sides a day in life.

The sound became more focused, but the raucous spirit that has kept people sweating since the beginning is just as tangible and, dare I say, primal as ever.
""What started out as a hashtag from some disgruntled audience member, ‘Sego Sucks’ ended up encapsulating the ethos behind this entire record.
The more I give in to the modern temptation to generate opinions and clever commentary about everything swirling around me, the more I realize I’m not an authority on much of anything. It’s probably fine not to have an opinion on everything. It’s probably fine not to be liked by everyone all the time.""

Shreveport, Louisiana-based quintet Seratones have put a lot of miles on their tour van since the 2016 release of their acclaimed debut record, Get Gone. The success of that record took the band to new places: touring with Charles Bradley and St. Paul & The Broken Bones, performing on NPR’s Tiny Desk Concerts and CBS This Morning (not to mention lots of festival bookings, including the 2017 Newport Folk Festival), and signing with New West Records. 
Singer and songwriter A.J. Haynes calls this “a new season of Seratones.” Returning Seratones members Jesse Gabriel, drums, and Adam Davis, bass guitar, form the kind of laser-focused rhythm section that you only get from bandmates who’ve been playing together since childhood. New band members Taryan Coker, keyboards, and Travis Stewart, guitar, add emotional heft to the groove-heavy new sound. In her acrobatic vocals, which can be seductive and slow as honey or fierce with joy and anger, Haynes showcases the musical inspirations that have shaped her life.

From guitars and tambourines come in clear, vocals like moans drenched in reverb and other effects decorated with the sound of running water and cavernous trumpet, to sometimes an idiosyncratic collision of lo-fi psych pop and aggressively dark electronic postpunk, that's only a little taste of what you can find in his seven years trajectory. There’s something bright and relaxing to it, but at the same time spooky and haunting. 
He has played in venues like Primavera Sound, Vida Festival, FIM Vila-Seca, Tbilisi Open Air, Canal+Menú Stereo, Sofar Sounds, Balcony TV...
He counts with two great EPs “The River” and “AHÁ”: especially this last one where Miles Raymer's article written for Noisey refered to it as ""a bunch of songs that were as unexpectedly weird as they were unexpectedly good"" and ""easy to find yourself putting on repeat"".
As well as his debut LP “Bit Kong” recorded two years later, Nika finally released his second album “Ellipsis” in January of 2018 and now he is cooking something new for this March 2019.

Her career soon took a leap when she signed her first record deal with Sir George Martin; the producer of the legendary band, The Beatles, in London. She was only eighteen years old at the time.

Seyi Shay released her debut album, ‘Seyi or Shay’ which housed a total of 15-tracks. 
In 2016, she pushed the boundary beyond familiar terrains by experimenting with a latino sound that birthed her recent smash, ‘Yolo Yolo’ and ‘BIA’, which was released in 2017. Continuing the streak of versatility, 2018 has seen her release a 7-track extended play titled ‘Electric Package’.

Lemon Lime, the St. Louis four-piece’s appropriately titled sophomore full-length, is a sweet and sharp sonic confection, each song a push and pull of jagged distortion and rich melodies. The album finds Shady Bug--comprised of guitarist/vocalist Hannah Rainey, guitarist Tom Krenning, drummer Aaron O’Neill, and bassist Chris Chartrand (Todd Anderson plays bass the on this recording)--twisting their brand of noisy, dynamic guitar pop into new directions.
Building on the promise of their 2017 debut, tbh idk, Lemon Lime further sharpens Shady Bug’s sound. “Make It Up” opens the album with a wall of explosive fuzz that barely gives the listener time to acclimate before shifting gears to a shimmering verse of interwoven guitars and Rainey’s warm voice. Her uniquely phrased melodies set the stage for the Lemon Lime’s lyrical explorations of late night hangouts, existential angst, and the poignancy of mundane moments—like the reference to sharing a can of Sprite that lends the record its’ title.

The support of Izzo - known for launching the careers of Gucci Mane, Future, and Young Thug - has allowed Shah to flourish despite rejecting major label deals, as he looks to become rap's first truly independent international superstar.

1547,Shelita Burke,"Having amassed 20+ million streams with her latest EP, Special and reaching #24 on Billboard, Shelita has been a trailblazer in adapting new technologies such as blockchain to show the world a new artist model that puts artists first. Shelita is the archetype of what is possible for modern artists. Raised in Seattle, she left for Europe to pursue a music career and tour the world playing over 150 shows as a recording artist. She made her first appearance in the pop music scene going viral on social media.
Shelita's unique vocal delivery evokes a strange beauty. It’s like describing the flavor of chocolate to someone who’s never had sweets. Adel's vocal ability, Bjork's boldness, and Beyoncé's emotional expression come together in Shelita's intimate, powerful sound.
Her musical style is both minimal and musical, a difficult feat for most artists. Shelita's memorable lyrics flutter through a range of musical genres, from R and B to future bass, hip-hop to EDM, trap to pop.

1548,Shepherds,"The healing hand and surgeon’s scalpel are intertwined on Shepherds’ new album ​Insignificant Whip​. The art-rock masterpiece encases the band’s vulnerable wisdom in flighty melodies that burn with intimacy and fragility as singer/lyricists Jonathan Merenivitch and Adrian Benedykt Świtoń address everything from toxic masculinity and Catholic guilt to Youtube comments and Tupac Shakur. Since their 2011 EP ​Holy Stain,​ the band have received accolades for their taut analyses of social ills and the resulting strain on body and mind, but even the skeletal no-wave that defined their early sound was bound with, in the broadest sense of the word, soul. The band’s ability to confront their deepest insecurities and doubts is more than simple catharsis, it serves to illuminate deeper questions of existence and identity, and frame them in context of systemic oppression, discrimination, and isolation. The band's expansive new LP ""Insignificant Whip"" will be released on Arrowhawk Records in 2019

songwriter Shirazee found himself in Atlanta with nothing but trialing experiences and a dream of
fracturing the juggernaut that is the rap industry. Though vitally settled in the city that bled rap
music, a new path would take shape that would soon define his career. That path was
songwriting. Though ingrained in his DNA through countless years of artistry, surrendering the
pen to the needs of other artists was uncharted territory. This soon led to his departure from the
city that represented what seemed like his lifelong dream to the city that sculpts, chisels and
molds it. While opportunity was deep-seated in the concrete arms of the rigorous goliath, New
York tested Shirazee’s resilience. Overcoming homelessness he soon signed his first publishing
deal and found himself at the helm of songs by artists like Sting, Afrojack, Ty Dolla $ign, and
more. Fast forward to 2018 and
encompassing experience, influence and his widespread musical pallet, Shirazee releases
“MAKE WILD”, a feel-great tune that calls for intentness in what has always been his
foreordained playground.

Hometown: Baltimore, MD
Age: 22
Northeast Baltimore’s Shordie Shordie is the closest thing the city has to a Lil Uzi Vert-like character. When looking at the artists who have gotten citywide support over the past few years, he is surely the most flamboyant and eccentric. Shordie’s dances and scratchy harmonies have created some of the best entertainment to come out of the city in recent memory. When it comes to making amazing hooks he is undefeated, gaining him his hilarious but fitting nickname, Captain Hook. Shordie has mastered the art of engaging with his fans while still remaining to keep the suspense alive by posting and deleting Instagram snippets of songs off his debut project - Captain Hook. The songs are mostly comprised of almost alien-sounding trap ballads about failed attempts at love. The clips are so enticing that fans take it upon themselves to upload compilations of them to YouTube to hold them over until he finally drops.
Shordie finally gave the people what they wanted with his 9 track release on December 08, 2018. Since the release, Shordie has created an impressive amount of buzz around his tape as a whole but the contagiously catchy rec

1555,Shorty,"Shorty may be forever known as “the shortest man in grime”’ but what he lacks in height, he makes up for in sheer tenacity on the mic. Having signed to BBK in 2006, it wasn’t until he contributed to the label’s first charting single “Too Many Man” in 2009 that his involvement was fully realized.
Since then, Shorty has become paramount to the crew’s live performances, actively wrecking sound systems with his definitive flow. This came to a head during 2014’s Red Bull Culture Clash between A$AP Mob, Rebel Sound, Stone Love and Boy Better Know where, despite clamorous disapproval from the crowd, Rebel Sound took the crown over BBK. Many believe the decision was wrong, and Shorty’s bars on the night were a big part of that.
Largely shunning the limelight, Shorty has remained perhaps BBK’s most humble spokesperson, for the most part uninterested in the big business gluttony of the mainstream and driven purely by grime’s infamous DIY spirit.

Shy Beast has introduced itself and offered its complex and appealing music over the past year, but now, in “My Stride,” it demonstrates its power. It is clear how the group appeals to many with its various themes and open atmospheres of possibility.  Shy Beast hails from Austin but plays to the entire world. The music showcases Mariclaire Glaeser’s immense vocal range and tones of diamond clarity.  Her voice is feminine but also liberated and absolutely commanding of the songs.  The guitars of David Tenczar and Andrew Bennett are undeterred in growing the forest of melodies in which Glaeser sings. Drew Silverman’s unmistakable drumming guides us through the musical abundance and back again, all hits, no misses.  Farther down in the sonic underworld, Jay Cesak’s bass rhythms don’t wait for verses, choruses or instrumental breaks.  They continue to call until we become the monster and dance with the beast. Newcomers to Shy Beast’s music may be assured that yes, the band plays electro-pop, but the boundaries of that are sure to be re-drawn with this new creature entering the musical fray.

Their album, Bell House, was released August 2018 on Polyvinyl. The album’s title is taken from the band’s beloved headquarters – the old house on Bell Street in Kansas City where they lived together for the better part of 5 years. 
“‘Lived’ is a loose term,” says Collin. “It was more like a bum den than anything else. There was a giant hole in the floor of the kitchen that had a piece of plywood over it. In the backyard, weeds got like 6 feet high in the summer. It was its own thriving biome. We lived in trash.”
Musically, Collin describes the songs on Bell House taking shape through “a group of guys trying to get through some sort of mutual identity crisis. The lifestyle became overwhelming and really seeped into the music.”
The band has spent the bulk of the past year on the road in support of the album, touring with Cut Worms, Strfkr, La Luz, Wavves, and Frankie Cosmos, quickly earning a reputation as a spellbinding live band.

After posting “Heels” on Soundcloud and cultivating a devoted Instagram following for their hilarious and self-deprecating/self-celebrating queer memes, Sir_Babygirl began courting the attention of multiple labels, including Father/Daughter Records, with whom they eventually signed in April 2018.

A sole composer/singer Jenny Gillespie Mason begins the process sketching lyrics and melodies alone in a room,  but the rest is a serendipitous, scary and smooth recording combustion between players in the studio, namely core members Mason, electric guitarist Carly Bond (Meernaa) and keyboardist Rob Shelton (Meernaa, John Vanderslice). The music of their debut album Euphorbia (Native Cat Recordings, 2018) is an experiment in soulful R&B romantics with an undercurrent of breathless risk. While a disparate array of influences materializes on the record Euphorbia, from Sade to Steve Reich, something truly new is created the collective energy from each player’s musical lineage. They've since released a single ""Nightie,"" an ode to UFO dreams, Jungian stirrings, and the restless hypnotics of Talking Heads, to be included on their forthcoming 2019 sophomore LP Gas Station Roses. The new record recorded with drummer Otto Hauser (Devendra Banhart, Cass McCombs) and percussionist Brijean Murphy (Toro Y Moi, US Girls).

1572,Sixteen Deluxe,"Sixteen Deluxe is a psychedelic noise-pop band from Austin, Texas, best known for their energetic, deafening live performances and lysergic studio creations. Formed in 1994, they quickly generated a heap of buzz in Austin, filling local clubs with a kinetic mix of sonic assault, pop melodies, smoke, lights, and film projections. From 1995-2000, the band released three full-length LPs, three EPs, and four singles, working with renowned producers John Croslin (GBV), Mike McCarthy (Spoon), and Keith Cleversley (Mercury Rev). After gaining MTV buzz with their 1995 ""Idea"" single, the band journeyed from indie labels to majors and back again throughout the 90’s, before disbanding in 2000.
Sixteen Deluxe reformed to play a series of gigs in 2010, including a benefit for Austin's SIMS Foundation, Roky Erickson's Psychedelic Ice Cream Social, and FunFunFun Fest. During SXSW '12, the band were inducted into the Austin Music Hall of Fame, and later took part in GrulkeFest, a public memorial celebrating the life of SXSW’s Brent Grulke. In 2015, Sixteen Deluxe released a 7"" of newly recorded material, their first since 2000. New music and archival re-issues are primed for future release.

Phil Owen (aka Phildo) developed a brand of music that stole from every aspect of outlaw genres such as punk rock, heavy metal, rap, hillbilly and every sacred rock and roll anthem vulnerable to its taking. After landing a deal with the Chicago based Wax Trax Records, through an introduction from his Revolting Cocks cohort and Ministry’s main man Al Jourgensen, Phildo penned the now classic song “Chemical Imbalance.” Years of reckless abandon would result later signing with Megaforce Records, known for their connection to breaking Metallica, a classic episode of “Beavis and Butthead,” video plays on MTV’s Headbangers Ball, several successful tours with Ministry, KMFDM, GWAR, FEAR etc. and a failed European tour with TOOL which brought the band to a break up that would later be revived by Phildo. 2016 brought the release of the band’s most current album “Adult Entertainment for Kids” which fe

1578,SLEEPWALKERS,"It’s easy to claim that certain musicians live and breath the music they love, but rarely will you find a group as versed and versatile as Sleepwalkers. The band grew out of the partnership between Richmond-based brothers Michael and Austin York, who were raised by a soul- and funk-loving mother and a father who was partial to rock. Listening. Internalizing. Developing an uncanny understanding of what makes music from different eras great, and how to synthesize it to make something new and precise. Sleepwalkers was formed when the brothers met drummer Alex DeJong. The group’s first show took place in November of 2013, and they’ve since shared stages with The Shins and Matthew E. White, crisscrossed the country in a Lincoln Towncar as part of The Lumineers headlining bill and joined numerous bills with J. Roddy Walston & The Business, who have served as mentors and frequent onstage collaborators. Their on-stage dynamism is a natural extension of the core trio’s studio work, which is entirely self-engineered and produced.

Consisting of Danish-American brothers Jakob and Oliver Mueller and their childhood friend David Dugan, the band solidified in 2014 after a decade of high school bands came to an end. After cutting teeth in the Denver music scene, the band garnered attention from Old Flame Records and subsequently released the EP, Desert Minded in 2017. The following year they released a double A side picture disc (Poser/Rover). The band spent two years touring extensively, highlighted by performances at SXSW and Treefort Music Festival. They have opened for national acts such as Third Eye Blind, Cake, Rooney, DIIV, Cold War Kids, The Kills, and Modest Mouse.

Thrown together purely by accident for an anniversary show at Winnipeg’s venerable West End Cultural Centre, The Small Glories is a partnership that could almost make you believe in fate.  With a stage banter striking a unique balance between slapstick and sermon, these veteran singer-songwriters have a way of making time disappear, rooms shrink, and audiences feel as they are right there on the stage with the band.  It’s not uncommon for listeners to find themselves laughing, dancing, crying, or caught up in a good ol’ fashioned sing-along.  Their material is rootsily welcoming — songs of love, loss, & environment, delivered with soaring, interwoven vocals on various combinations of stomping clawhammer banjo & guitar. The two have an innate chemistry  — a chemistry labeled the “Lennon-McCartney syndrome,” by Americana UK, writing, “Some things just work together… to witness a performance by TSG is a rare opportunity to experience that indefinable quality that creates perfection.”

The band have recently released their third collection, Too Big To Fail, which has received positive feedback from listeners and critics alike. Laura Shine, Assistant Program Director/On-Air Host at Louisville WFPK, says of the band: “Small Time Napoleon is poised for big time things.

Annie Long and Mary Bryce fortify the outfit with stunning vocal harmonies, and provide a spectacle at live shows with matching alien-esque attire and singular dance moves. Other members include Harrison Anderson on the bass and Everett Bergstedt on the drums. “Sunny dissonance, avant garde pop, and playful instrumentation inform SMiiLE’s warm sincerity,” says The Austin Chronicle. Instrumentally, SMiiLE is notably polyrhythmic and complex, but with a pop influenced buoyancy that satiates. 
Following the release of their first full length album, ""Like A Diamond In The Rough, You Shine,"" the band united their following with a continually expanding repertoire of new songs.  Stay tuned, as they are on track to release 2 singles and a music video every month of 2019.

1587,Smokey Brights,"Seattle’s Smokey Brights is a story of love and pizza. Husband and wife duo Ryan Devlin and Kim West first met while slinging pies at a south Seattle restaurant in their early 20s. Devlin, a fixture in the Northwest’s thriving DIY rock scene, and West, an aspiring law student, started writing and recording songs in Devlin’s bedroom during a cash-strapped Christmas as their friendship blossomed into romance. Pulling from their mutual love of 70s rock, vintage synthesizers, thrift shop treasures, and early MTV, the pair’s bond permeated their pop songcraft. The duo,  joined by drummer Nick Krivchenia and bassist Luke Logan, create a stoney blend of Northwest rock & roll and razor-sharp disco grooves that Impose Magazine has called “a modern bit of AM radio gold.”
The group released their first LP, Taste For Blood, in 2014 to regional acclaim and heavy airplay and support from iconic radio station KEXP. Catching the attention of upstart label Freakout Records, the band released their sophomore LP, Hot Candy, in 2016. 2018 saw the band releasing two EP's, ""Come to Terms"" and ""Different Windows,"" with supporting appearances at clubs and festivals across the United States and the UK.

1588,smut,"“It seems lately that terms like “shoegaze” and “dreampop” have been used at such ad nauseum that they have been essentially rendered useless. Any band that so much as uses an effect pedal or feedback has one or the other slapped onto their description.This is unfortunate, because every so often a real, tried and true, dreamy, noisy, poppy, shoegaze band emerges. Fortunately for us, such a band has taken form and materialized from none other than Cincinnati, Ohio. This band is Smut.
Smut is noise pop for the people. Marrying all of the good parts of all of the good genres the band has mastered their craft. Guitarists Andrew Min and Sam Ruschman bring tastefully fuzzed out and distorted riffs to the table; held up by the unmistakably solid rhythmic framework laid down by bassist Bell Cenower and drummer Harold Bon; and at the forefront of it all, is vocalist Tay Roebuck. At times commanding and peremptory, there are other moments where the power of her voice is matched by the rest of the band. Within that control is a distinct effortlessness and this sets her apart while simultaneously fashioning the band’s purist shoegaze identity.

Highway Hypnosis, her forthcoming album on Merge Records that will drop in January, plays on hip-hop, post-punk, and invented words to fill a gap between the feminist underground and genre-specific singles charts. Through it, Moolchan joins the resistance forged by queer black feminists who create, explore, empower, conquer, and play bass.
The solo act, born with Pluto in Scorpio, released her first single “Beliefs” in September. The glimmering anthem shrouded in an atmosphere of darkness drops its beat along with a call to arms for all non-believers whose mantra is assigned: “Remove your beliefs and start again / ’cause all I wanna do is start again.” 
Flashes of Robyn, Britney Spears, Jock Jams, Nirvana, recess hour on the blacktop, M.I.A., Lil Mama, a hacky sack circle, Aaliyah, and your first Warped Tour experience somehow all make sense inside the mind attached to ears experiencing Highway Hypnosis.

It’s a restlessness that rocks back and forth, back and forth. It’s the suffering that starts in the corner of your mind and ends with total loss of identity and control. It’s the grim realisation that you are not who you thought you were, and that the only way you can face your most excruciating fears is through an unforgiving, unadulterated pop song. Or as the intro to SOAK’s extraordinary second album of the same name puts it – ‘you are now entering the southbound train to Grim Town. Please surrender any faith, passportation or optimism to platform staff if you haven’t already. Refreshments will not be available on this service. Thank you and enjoy your journey.’

1598,The Song by Lex Empress,"Lex Empress is a master of improvisation who aims to empower people to live their fullest potential through her performance. Using her kaleidoscopic array of skills, a seemingly limitless imagination and a touch of magic, she is the only person in the world that interactively weaves lyrics, melodies and chords into coherent stories and whole compositions on the spot. All the songs are completely improvised, sound like radio songs and she can deliver them in seven languages! Blessed with a 4 octave vocal range and an angelic voice, she sings on festival stages and at intimate gatherings, where her ability to tune in with the crowd leaves people both floored and deeply inspired. All this comes with some great profundity yet with a sense of whimsy and fun too. The basic idea: a life improvised, is a life well lived and demystifies creation as being exclusive and complicated.
Lex performs with amazing musicians from all over the world, who also improvise everything they play and she mostly meets just before a show. Lex Empress is a fascinating artist that defy any category or description, always congenially accessible yet never failing to mesmerise the listener. A must hear!Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.Artist is seeking the following professional connections: Label, Management, Booking Agent - US, Booking Agent - UK/Europe, Booking Agent - Worldwide, PR/Publicity Agency",Singer-Songwriter,Freestyle,"Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS",http://audio.sxsw.com/2019/mp3_by_artist_id/00b7e4f7c13f0ce0c2cae4e4a15b7ae47f6b47e40d4e79e1d7a6a1515518e06f.mp3,The Song by Lex Empress at Edwin's,"Mar 11, 2019",9:15pm-10:15pm,Edwin's

Throughout his burgeoning career, the artist had attracted a fervent following and critical acclaim on the 2014 solo offering, Seventeen Acres, released under his legal name. In the years since, the music transformed into a blend of delicate dissonance, distorted slide guitar transmissions, sequenced beats, vinyl samples and warm electronics, culminating in the April debut of SONTALK: Act I EP on Sony Music Masterworks. Initially meant as an introduction to his full-length debut, the EP’s lead single “I Am a War Machine” garnered praise right out of the gate as Stereogum claimed, “LeMay sounds vulnerable, but the sunny thumping instrumentation delivers enough momentum to aid in a kind of soul-saving atonement.”As he took the project on the road, the track generated over a million streams within a few months. The conversation has just begun.

1602,Sophie Auster,"Relinquishing inhibition and apprehension fosters creativity in its purest form. By letting go, an artist invariably flourishes. Sophie Auster embodies this phenomenon.
The New York singer and songwriter leverages the freedom to soulfully speak her mind and share truths by way of vivid songwriting cast over swaths of lush acoustic guitars and dense piano chords.
Between ceaseless touring, 2016 saw her achieve the grand prize at The John Lennon Songwriting Contest, while Cosmopolitan Magazine named her “Singer of the Year” in Spain where she also graced the publication’s cover. Along the way, she penned what would become her third full- length album and first release for BMG, Next Time.
Emblematic of her growth, the first single “Mexico” plays out like a long lost fifties South-of-the-Border-set film noir. Punctuated by boisterous horns and an irresistible chant, the track illuminates both vocal charisma and a knack for storytelling.
Next Time will be released through BMG, March 15th 2019.

1605,Soriah,"Soriah is the stage persona of Enrique Ugalde, a performance artist and instrumentalist who has trained for decades in the art of Tuvan throat singing.
Birthed in one of the most historically isolated locations on the planet, Tuvan throat singing is a musical sound like no other. Mysterious, primordial and awash in a deeply visceral drone, it invokes the full range of the natural world – from steadfast mountain roots to the whistle of birds in flight.
Soriah’s music synthesizes traditional Tuvan throat singing, pre-Columbian Mexica sounds, classical Indian raga and various Western styles – a stunning musicality spanning continents. He plays traditional Tuvan instruments, incorporates Japanese Butoh and infuses his performances with costumes and rituals from around the world. Soriah’s lyrics are often written in Nahuatl (Aztec) or Tuvan and showcase his themes of mindfulness and exaltation in the infinite essence each sound holds.
Whether entirely traditional or a contemporary fusion of notes, instruments, movement and meditation, Soriah’s offerings convey his reverence for the mystery of existence.

1606,Sorry Girls,"Picture your fiercest-self taking your more introverted-self on a loving pep-talk-fueled shopping spree. Imagine the feeling of driving down the highway listening to Springsteen with a car full of friends; pair that with the comfort of lying in bed next to a bag of M&M peanuts watching Twin Peaks. Welcome to Sorry Girls.
Easier – their new 7” / double single – presents a culmination in Sorry Girls’ sound. Equally steeped in lament and celebration, its two songs are driven by uplifting vocals and synth-heavy arrangements. Cruisin’ power pop that cries equally with joy and sorrow. All the pleasure and regret felt by a hypochondriac who can’t resist a good cigarette.
Sorry Girls is a Montreal based duo consisting of Heather Foster Kirkpatrick and Dylan Konrad Obront. The two met in 2008 while studying at university, making joke songs on GarageBand together over pots of Kraft Dinner on the floor of their friend’s apartment. Though they didn’t collaborate on anything serious for many years, there was an immediate pull to create music together. It wasn’t until one serendipitous afternoon almost eight years later that they pooled their combined interest in powerful pop ballads to write

In 2012 atop an abandoned building was were these eclectic musicians first came together. The band started as an instrumental group that played numerous loud and restless parties throughout their hometown. This recognition led them to be one of the most go-to bands in their area. It was in 2016 that a concatenation of life events led them to rename the band Spendtime Palace. Right after releasing their debut album Playdate along with “Lily Lee” and “Closed Doors,” keyboardist Michael (Toast) became a part of the band. This addition to the band induced a more exuberant sound, which lead to the creation of the Sonora EP. Title track “Sonora” gained instant recognition from the likes of Billboard, staring Stranger Things  Finn Wolfhard and directed by Josh Ovalle. Spendtime Palace is set to release their second album with acclaimed producer Kyle Mullarky titled All Inclusive Romantic Getaway in early 2019.

The band had a breakout year in 2017, releasing 2 EPs and playing packed venues and festivals across the US opening for top acts like Questlove and Walk The Moon. That momentum continued into 2018 with the February release of ‘Patterns,’ a synthwave groove illustrating the band’s penchant for timeless hooks with a modern edge. The single was streamed over 43,000 times in its first week and has received radio play across the US, UK, and Mexico. 
Sphynx made their maiden voyage to the UK in early March where they logged 6 headline performances for enthusiastic crowds; selling out the famed Troubadour in London, garnering praise from the prominent UK magazine The Music Site and collaborating with UK songwriters and DJs. With a placement on the series finale of CMT’s Nashville and a string of videos and singles set for 2019 Sphynx’s buzz is just beginning.

1623,Spiral Stairs,"Recent technological advances have had a massive impact on how people access music, allowing all and sundry to feast on songs of all persuasions at the tap of a button that previously may have taken years of searching – not to mention significant outlay – to get their hands on.

But it’s not just hordes of youngsters honing their musical chops by disappearing down internet rabbit holes to expand their musical vocabularies, bona fide indie rock legends are getting in on the action as well.

For his feelgood third solo album We Wanna Be Hyp-No-Tized, Pavement co-founder Scott Kannberg – best known to the musical world as Spiral Stairs – concocted some of the most fun and accessible music of his storied career by expanding his musical repertoire, in the process embracing some sounds and artists which for some reason or other slipped through the cracks as he took alternative rock to the world during his action-packed youth.

“To me We Wanna Be Hyp-No-Tized feels like the records I’ve been listening to and the records I’ve been digging and aspire to sound like,” Spiral offers. “In my early-twenties I felt like I knew everything – I always knew about new bands before everyone else – b

1624,SPIRITUAL & The Oufah Band,"“I’m here to preach and to practise love to all people. Love is the cure for everything. Love makes you healthy and I’m convinced that one day, scientists will discover that it’s the basis of living, y‘know? Because we should all be loving people, and that’s the key message in my music. It’s all about love and progress.”
Spiritual’s music transports us to another time, when reggae legends like Bob Marley first took the rebel sound of Jamaica to a worldwide audience. Authenticity can be heard in every note, but then it’s coming from the same source – not only musically and culturally, but even the same ghetto communities of West Kingston. Spiritual was raised in Allman Town, and sang in his local choir before embracing Rastafari. He was orphaned at an early age, and could have joined the throngs of young hopefuls at any number of studios and sound-systems scattered throughout the city. Instead, he shunned fame and helped to heal the broken society around him by counselling the poor and needy. Music was in his blood and he continued to write songs, but Rastafari was his true calling.

1625,Splurge,"Splurge is a 17-year-old East Arlington, Texas-based rapper who stands out as an innovator among his peers. Born Aaron Harbor Jr., the energetic upstart has only been rapping for less than two years but has tremendous untapped talent.
There weren’t any aspirations of being a performer growing up, but a lunchroom hobby during school became an intention when he cut a record that was supposed to be performed during his 16th birthday party alongside his cousin. Even though the party never happened, the track was released to local acclaim, much to his surprise. Once he felt the admiration and attention, Splurge became enamored.

“I’m the type of person that...I want all the juice and I want all the attention too, so I made me a song to perform at my party too,” he said. “I end up not having a party and I just released the song and [friends] wanted me to release some more.”

As he made more music, what immediately jumped out is the volatility of Splurge’s flow, a delivery that seems erratic, but fits perfectly over any head-splitting drums.

They started to think there might actually be something here and ended up with a recording deal with Spinefarm Records. 
After dropping their debut Farm Machine (2015) the band played 175 shows, toured in 20 countries and a dozen US states, Mere 16 months removed from the debut, the country dropped the foundations-shaking sophomore album, Brothers In Farms. it conquered the #1 position on the BillBoard Bluegrass Albums chart in January of 2016. 
On their third outing, Grainsville, the Gulls’ musical evolution gets more risqué. Instead of just having fun and merriment non-stop, the songs feature influences from World Music, such as Mariachi horns, stomping Balkanite beats and some flashy fiddling. 
With another landmark album under their belt it’s time for the Gulls to tour again ‘til the wheels fall off the wagon!

Initially a solo project, Stove has bloomed into a full-fledged band with the additions of drummer/vocalist Jordyn Blakely, bassist Alex Molini, and guitarist Mike Hammond. Now on their sophomore LP, the cheekily titled ‘s Favorite Friend, the band has truly come into their own to make an album that defines Stove’s identity and captures the four member’s extraordinary musical chemistry, as well as the joy and relief that can come from creating together in the midst of challenging times.
Stove’s 2015 debut, Is Stupider, was an extension of Ovlov’s DNA, but Hartlett soon discovered that when separated from the sonic parameters and expectations of that band’s work, he felt free to try out different dynamics and sounds--an excitement that would grow along with Stove’s lineup during the writing and recording sessions that became

1650,Stuyedeyed,"Irrepressible, loud, direct, fuzzed out — Stuyedeyed are an unhinged skull rattling atop a spine, snapping to intensity and directing your attention to our reality, right now. 
Originating in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, Stuyedeyed (pronounced sty’d - eyed) cultivate an unfettered attitude in their music to embolden the disenfranchised to challenge the status quo. 
These songs speak to the experiences of singer and songwriter Nelson Antonio Hernandez-Espinal and are brought to life with bassist Humberto Genão, drummer Luis Ruelas, and guitarist George Ramirez. 
Broadcasting a riotous energy to the important dialogues of our time in a tumultuous yet carefully articulated sonic wave that emanates resilience. Stuyedeyed depicts the experiences of being young Latinxs in a “New York-for-some” bubble. With rhythm, aggression, conviction, and cut teeth, they slash through a thick curtain of anxiety and depravity with urgency. 
Their challenge is to expose vulnerability, to swim in it and understand that in those deep waters, there is comfort. And if anything they are there with you, in every recording and at every show. Their message is simple. “No one is cool. No one is important.”

Hailing from the grittiest streets of Dallas, Tx, this dance-punk band has been making audiences stomp and sway since 2015. Their most recent release, Infatuation EP, showcases the group's ability to boogie down into the aquatic depths of the emotional abyss only to reemerge with a fighting spirit that refuses to stay down forever. Pick your heads up, shoegazers; Sub-Sahara isn't going to let you stand still too long.

1654,Sudakistan,"Regarded by many as ""the best live band in Sweden"", few bands can chalk up their signature musical style to the contrasts between their roots and their adopted hometown, but Sudakistan are one of them. The Stockholm five-piece announced their arrival on the punk scene proper in furious fashion with their incendiary debut record, Caballo Negro, by 2015; unsurprisingly for so an ambitious and irresistibly energetic album, it met with rave reviews across the board. What made it stand out from The crowd, though, was its interpolation of the band's backgrounds. Of Sudakistan's five members, only guitarist Arvid Sjöö is Swedish born-and-wide. The other  four  -  frontman  Michell  Serrano,  bassist  Maikel  Gonzalez,  percussionist  Carlos  Amigo  and  drummer  Juan  Jose  Espindola  -  all  hail  from  South  America  and  latin  musical  influences  are  a  key  part  of  their  sound,  particularly  in  terms  of  rhythm  and  groove;  lay  guitars  and  vocals  that  recall  the  likes  of  Oh  Sees,  At  the  Drive-In  and  Death  from  Above  over  the  top  of  that  and  you  have  a  potent  clash  of  styles  that  elevates  Sudakistan  above  their  peers.

1655,Sundrifter,"Born out of a Boston rock underground teeming with history and riffs alike, Sundrifter capture the essence of tonal weight with their Small Stone debut, Visitations. Their second album overall behind 2016’s Not Coming Back, the nine-track long-player harnesses spaciousness and heft alike and soars with melodic vibrancy in a way most acts simply can’t balance. Shades of Soundgarden and Queens of the Stone Age appear, but they’re just shades, and Sundrifter’s vision of heavy is their own, someplace between grunge, doom, psychedelia and classic heavy rock. 
Sundrifter is comprised of guitarist/vocalist Craig Puera, bassist Paul Gaughran and drummer Patrick Queenan, and Visitations was engineered, mixed and mastered by Dan Schwartz at Futura Productions in Roslindale, Massachusetts. The space the record captures isn’t of the Hawkwind, pulsating rhythm variety, but instead one that oozes with planetary motion, one that rolls along a chaotic cosmic path, not at all afraid to smash one asteroid off another before crashing to the surface, which, as we all know, is how life began in the first place.

They worked with Dan Duszynski (Cross Record, Loma) and fellow Malick alum Will Patterson (Sleep Good) on their first set of demos before solidifying the current line up of Michael Bain on guitar, Sarah Schultz on drums, and Justin Harris on bass.
On March 22, 2019, they’ll release Younger, a four song EP that serves as a companion piece to their debut. They’ll return to Europe to tour in April.

Bobbi has spent three years funneling the disparate sonics of America’s post-1978 Top 40 charts into their own smile-inducing, irreverently deadpan multi-media experience.
2017's 'Youth Music' found fans in Consequence of Sound, Office Magazine, and The 405, while launching the group onto the stages of Charli XCX Dorian Electra (in a performance art piece supporting Pussy Riot).

Super Doppler plays music largely inspired by an appreciation of the great records of the 1960’s and 70’s, while still drawing from an eclectic mix of contemporary influences. Originally from Norfolk, Virginia, Super Doppler has been touring the country extensively since the release of their debut album ‘Moonlight Anthems’ in 2017, produced by Matthew E. White of Spacebomb Records. In late 2017 the band recorded the six tracks of what would become ‘The Super Secret Singles Club’, released monthly throughout 2018. 2019 finds Super Doppler back in the studio working on their second full-length album and ready to hit the road again.

1660,Superfónicos,"Superfónicos was formed when bassist Nico Sanchez and guitarist Erick Bohorquez began discussions about creating a group with a foundation in Afro-Colombian rhythms. They soon teamed up with guitarist Andres Villegas and percussionist Daniel Sanchez, and started rehearsing together during time away from their other projects. That core group developed the band’s unique sound, laying the foundation for what was to come. In 2016, gaitero and vocalist Jaime Ospina relocated from Colombia to Austin, where he met and instantly connected with the group.
The band’s success has been the outcome of organic growth and auspicious timing.  Notable sets such as the Austin City Limits Music Festival, Levitation, and KGSR’s Blues on the Green, have catapulted the group into the spotlight.

Surfbort’s live experience is visceral and confrontational. Their feedback-strafed, guitar-shredding punk music says no to a digital age full of intolerance; they radiate love and friendship. All are welcome in the SURFBORT FREAK FAMILY! Fresh off a tour with The Black Lips after playing this year’s Coachella, the band just released ‘Bort to Death’ a raw 4-track 7” on Hozac Records.

Find a new town, new coast, or new state of mind––then make it yours. “We export this idea of getting in your car and going somewhere, trying to find something new, bouncing around,” says Justin Osborne. “We live in some strange, crazy times. There is a sense of darkness. But I’m crisscrossing the country, and people are good and fun. There is a lot of beauty everywhere. I think not forgetting that is important.
Osborne is home in Charleston, South Carolina, reflecting on the personal journey and cultural climate that have led to Ever Since I Lost My Mind, the third record and label debut for his acclaimed project SUSTO. The album is a resounding triumph: a mix of new partnerships and collaborations with old friends, all anchored by Osborne’s perceptive songs that explore connection, loss, and transience––and the pain and joy each brings. 
“Ever Since I Lost My Mind is very personal. This collection of songs came together over the course of a couple of years, and they all represent different moments,” he says. “It felt cathartic writing all of them, and they were also all fun in different ways.”

For the second record the musicians are now even more focussed on their true strengths. Inspired by a trip to Prague they wrote a song cycle called Suprafon. To maintain their focus on record they flew all the way to Austin, Texas to record their new album that is both - a natural evolution and a brand new start. While the energy of the band lingered around the corner on ""Moon Bordeaux“ it is now in full flight on these new songs. Suzan Köcher‘s mystical Psychedelia is infused with beautiful melodies, biting guitars and reverberated synths. Shades of Krautrock, Psych-Folk and French Pop float through the new songs that are at once enthralling and loose. Through many live shows her and her band have developed a unique sound fueled by Suzan´s magical voice, haunting melodies, fearless experimentation and rusty musical instruments that colour their sound in all shades of withered glory. Let her take you on a trip to the nearest far away place.

The six-piece band consistently delivers exciting shows featuring enough drums for a small marching band, exuberantly bellowed harmonies, and lyrics that jump from English to Louisiana French in a single verse. Boasting surnames like Marceaux and Chachere, Sweet Crude seeks to reconnect with their lineage in a way that draws on their own modern influences, while nodding to the music and language of their ancestors.  
Sweet Crude released their debut LP Créatures in April of 2017 on Rhyme and Reason Records and followed the release with performances at major US festivals such as Bonnaroo, New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and High Sierra. In addition to headlining their own US tour in April and May of 2017, they hit the road with their dear friends, Tank and the Bangas, on a sold-out nationwide club tour that lasted through the summer and fall. In 2018, Sweet Crude is scheduled to record their major label debut album on Verve Records, tour Europe, and return to the US festival circuit.

1670,Swervedriver,"Space travel rock’n’roll” – that’s how the band initially self-identified their sound. 2015’s I Wasn’t Born To Lose You trumpeted some eternal Swervedriver virtues: the intricate, fissile guitar patterns of Adam Franklin and Jimmy Hartridge, baked hard then dispatched in giant monolithic waves by the tactile rhythm section. As the opening song “Autodidact” had it: “Holy fuel forever spilled”.
        The new album is titled Future Ruins. It opens with a song narrated by a familiar Swervedriver archetype: a traveler, hurtling away from this world. But where is the traveler headed? The second song, “The Lonely Crowd Fades In The Air”, offers some possible answers.
        And the journey continues as Swervedriver rides on.  Future Ruins presents a band moving with real time vitality. It showcases new tricks: pop songs which don’t have choruses, odd arrangements and weird contrasts, like “Spiked Flower”’s rock’n’roll grind breaking out to acknowledge English landscape painter John Constable; and a lyric that references Echo & The Bunnymen. See if you can spot that one… 
        Swervedriver will be careening through their set infused with road-slick fumes this year at SXSW…..

Using customised software, filmmaker Lucas van Woerkum follows the conductor and orchestra’s interpretation, matching tempi and dynamics to create a visual layer as he performs as ‘image soloist’.  In contrast to the modern 'film live in concert' format, the film responds to the music. Conductors and orchestras are free to perform completely unrestricted and interpret the music as they wish, whilst the audience is drawn even deeper into the stories of the music. Symphonic Cinema debuted in 2010, and in 2015 the first feature-length production (Stravinsky The Firebird) received five sell-out performances at the Royal Concertgebouw, Amsterdam, after which the film toured around the world with highlights in London with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and in Beijing at the National Center for the Performing Arts.

1675,Table Scraps,"""Listen to more Table Scraps!"" Joe Talbot, IDLES
Celebrated for their bruising and feedback-drenched live shows, as well as a knack for the perfect nagging hook, Table Scraps have fought their way to the top of the garage rock pile by conquering stages and refusing to compromise.
'Autonomy', the band's most recent LP, surfaced in February 2018 to widespread enthusiasm, earned plays on BBC 6 Music and Radio 1, and was picked up for release in the US by the legendary Burger Records. A huge European tour with stoner legends Monster Magnet (at the insistence of Dave Wyndorf himself) quickly brought Table Scraps to a new legion of continental headbangers.

Taco Mouth (produced by Michael Wagener (Metallica, Skid Row, etc.)) sounds like 60s-era rock with pop hooks; think the Ramones and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. They’ve since added lead guitarist Shawn Hammer and bassist Flip Cooper, and together, they’ve created a true musical reemergence similar to the old CBGB days where rock mattered.

1677,Taimane,"HAWAII’S FLAMENCO UKULELE VIRTUOSO
Songwriter & virtuoso, Taimane, is best known for her fierce and inventive style of playing the ukulele. Her attraction to the four-string island staple began at age 3, and by age 10, she regularly performed in public, busking in Waikiki every Friday night with her father holding down security duties and Waikiki Beach Boys (adults whose home & workplace was the beach) serving as her band. By age 13, Taimane landed a position in Don Ho’s show literally playing in the spotlight every week until Ho’s passing. Fast forward to today, and you have an artist who tours the world and has carved out a unique niche in music –merging a wide-array of genres, from Bach to rock, flamenco infernos to tribal hymns, summoning a seemingly limitless palette of emotions via an instrument previously viewed as restricted.

“Tallies have a jangly sound that at times recalls The Smiths, The Sundays and other ’80s alt bands, but singer Sarah Cogan’s smoky vocals pull things into other territory” – BROOKLYN VEGAN
“While they’re still in their relative infancy, you might want to get out and see them live, so you can say “I saw them when…” – THE 405
TALLIES navigate an unfamiliar world on their confident self-titled debut album, which blends elements of shoegaze, dream pop, and surf rock into a fresh sound that’s all their own. The band was founded by singer and rhythm guitarist Sarah Cogan and lead guitarist Dylan Frankland, a couple who met in a sound engineering class. Tallies’ sound was fully realized with the addition of Frankland’s friend from childhood rock camp, drummer Cian O’Neill, and bassist Stephen Pitman. In a year since relocating to Toronto, the quartet have played shows with bands like Mudhoney, Hatchie and Weaves.

1680,Talos,"“A lot of this new record was written in transit,” says Eoin French, the Irish artist better known as Talos. “Being away from the safety of my home and my studio allowed me to create in a different way. It was a terrifying feeling sometimes, but it also really rewarding.”
While Talos will always be connected to his native Ireland, his stunning second LP, ‘Far Out Dust' - made with longtime production partner, Ross Dowling (James Vincent McMorrow, Bell X1) and a slew of collaborators including producers Doug Schadt (Maggie Rogers, Wet) and Valgeir Sigurðsson (Sigur Ros, Feist) and mixer Damian Taylor (Bjork, Arcade Fire) - draws on a wider perspective, melding tracks written and recorded in New York, Los Angeles, London, Dublin, Cork, and Reykjavik. 
The result is both French’s most confident songwriting and his most sophisticated studio work yet, an album that oscillates between hushed introspection and explosive ecstasy as it grapples with the pain of doubt and regret.

Although the majority of the playing heard on ‘Amir’ is Tamino himself, he is joined by a collective of Arabic musicians based in Brussels called ‘Nagham Zikrayat’. The Firka (Ochestra) is predominantly made up of professional musicians from the Middle East, most of which have refugee status having predominantly fled from Iraq and Syria. 
Over the course of ‘Amir’, Tamino captures a range of emotions from romance to desolation, and almost everything in between. It’s mood music, painted in a number of different shades.

1686,TarantisT,"Formed in 2000 by a group of young underground metal heads, TARANTIST originated in the basement alternative rock and heavy metal scenes in their native Tehran, Iran. Having to perform secretly-but-loudly often proved to be difficult, but after sparking a following via word of mouth in the underground, the band soon began to garner international recognition. Within just a few years, international media correspondents inspired by their story (including BBC, SKY, CNN, NPR, Metal Hammer and Kerrang) started visiting Tehran to meet and talk with TARANTIST. These news reports and articles aided TARANTIST in cultivating a worldwide following – motivating the band to relocate to the United States Los Angeles in 2008.

Although remaining positive, TARANTIST quickly found that they weren’t able to fully escape the pressures they faced back home, stemming from “not being Muslim enough”. Once they arrived in the United States, they experienced opposite – uncomfortable stereotypes and assumptions directed at them simply based on their culture and/or how they looked – all the while never practicing religion in the first place. Determined, TARANTIST didn’t let this slow them down.

In the world she conjures within the album, there's plenty of room to forge your own home where you can rejuvenate and heal—where you don't have to be a superhero and you don't have to save the world all by yourself, where nothing is expected of you except that you just be. It's the kind of album you can curl into after a hot summer day in the city: a powerful talisman in a demanding world, and a reminder that kindness toward the self can help unlock the way to a world a little more livable than this one.

1691,Taylor Janzen,"“The powerful simplicity of a voice, a guitar, a restrained melody and a raw emotion has been rediscovered by songwriters like Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers and now Taylor Janzen.” - The New York Times
Growing up, Taylor had a religious upbringing in Winnipeg, MT attending a small school up until graduation. Her family and friends never talked to one another about difficult things they were experiencing in life, and if they ever needed help, they turned to religion for answers.
 
Unable to talk through her issues in mental health, Taylor turned to songwriting as an outlet and, as a result, with each song on ""Interpersonal” we're granted an intimate and almost painstakingly brazen glimpse into the most heart wrenching pages of her diary. She writes candidly, “the music that I write is very honest, so it speaks for itself.”
 
“The thing is, my personality isn’t as depressing as my music is,” adds Taylor. Often tweeting about Dennis Quaid and the occasional Paramore cover (one of which went viral with 25k+ retweets and got the endorsement from Hayley Williams herself) every little thing Taylor shares with the world is magic, finding beauty in even the darkest mundane moments.

1696,TEEN,"The band TEEN came together at the turn of the decade, but its members have known each other their whole lives. Teeny, Lizzie, and Katherine Lieberson are sisters. Although they grew up in a musically vibrant Halifax home—their father was the esteemed composer Peter Lieberson—their first band jelled once they all lived in New York.
Good Fruit, the band’s fourth and newest album, is its sharpest thesis yet. A meditation on life after love, it’s thematically the opposite of its predecessor, 2016’s Love Yes, which The Guardian praised as “reminiscent of…inventive late-70s to mid-80s pop groups.” Musically, though, Good Fruit is the logical evolution of Love Yes’ massive uptick in synth use and sticky-hot choruses. The album boasts self-assured, skyrocketing synthpop anthems including “Only Water” and “Runner,” which betray the crucial lessons the sisters took from experiencing the distinct, enlivening ways that their myriad Love Yes tourmates employed synths. As with all TEEN albums, there are haunting ballads, most notably “Pretend,” which swells into a roaring synthetic climax as it details a relationship’s failure, a bold statement on moving forward and letting go of the past.

While technically a “dark punk” band, they cast a wider net to capture their musical and ideological influences than the majority of other darkwave and deathrock acts that have cropped up in recent years. Their creative process is a fluid amalgam of influences spanning from The Symbolists, The Viennese Actionists, what the band describes as “Romantic Essentialism”, and various proto- and post- punk artists from within and outside the main currents of their genres. It’s no small miracle that Terminal A manage to leverage this heady creative bedrock and still deliver emotionally penetrative jams that aim for the gut and the groin, that are still undeniably rock and roll in nature."" - Arjun Rey, Sovo Mag

1704,The Texas Gentlemen,"“Best Gigs of 2018: The Texas Gentlemen-London Shepherd’s Bush Hall” - Classic Rock
Don’t let the name fool you; this is no band of straight ahead southern hicks. Previously an in-demand backing group for the countrified likes of Kris Kristofferson and Leon Bridges, The Texas Gentlemen mix Americana, jazz, surfy harmonies, blues, rock’n’roll and a bunch of other stuff into infectious nuggets and jams. All of which came to light - in surprisingly magnificent style - at this midweek show. 
We like the Gentlemen’s debut album, TX Jelly, but this gig was a whole other level of musical mastery. Without saying a great deal, and with any established ‘hits’ in their repertoire, they conveyed the full weight of their collective talents with effortless class and charisma. They didn’t even play our personal favorites, and we still came away thinking it was the best thing we’d seen all year - and one of the best gigs we’d been to… well, ever. 
But maybe that’s what you get with a team of shit-hot session players who click like this; a colorful, boundaries-be-damned but super tight fusion, built on first-class tunes. And best of all, they made it look so damn fun and easy.

Posted up in the outskirts of Bangkok, Thaiboy was hard at work and quickly released the ’Lord of The Jewels’ mixtape, followed by standalone single releases produced by GUD, Palmistry and DJ Kenn. Then, in late 2016, the bladee collaborative album ’AvP’ dropped - clearly marking that through all the trials and tribulations, Thaiboy had continued to grow, constantly looking to evolve and find new ways of expression in order to escape this daily struggles. On his latest release ’S.O.S’ EP he emerged re-energised and re-invented, effortlessly floating across the rapping/singing border and back.

Los Angeles transplants Sivan Levy and Yael Enosh met (while Sivan was an Israeli academy award actress and director and Yael was an established classical pianist) working on a soundtrack for a 2018 Tel Aviv Museum exhibition and quickly forged an intense collaborative practice grounded in strikingly similar artistic visions and instincts. Enosh’s profound classical scholarly met Levy’s sultry, dark nostalgia pop vocals in a prolific creative partnership. 
Uprooting themselves to begin anew in LA, the electro-pop duo has cultivated a distinct sound fusing synth dreamscapes and energized eurorack, taking on the underground scene and art show circuit. 
Influenced by Blonde Redhead, Portishead, Nils Frahm, Daughter, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Thom Yorke.

The overwhelming fan response landed Woods a spot on Tobe's brief U.S. tour (which has now been extended to include a Houston date). His jazzy vocal style and chill-hop vibe do little to distract from the refined intellectualism he brings to his verses. In fact, the clarity of his vocals bring those woke bars to the forefront of his every track.
Tim keeps his growing fan base entertained with his weekly freestyle project, Mulch Mundays ...

1731,"""Tommy McLain & CC Adcock Swamp Pop Songbook"" Tommy McLain, CC Adcock, Steve Riley, Dave Ranson","Tommy McLain is considered a founding father of the Gulf Coast “swamp pop"" Genre - A bonafide ""Swamp-Poppa"". 
Known for his stunning voice, in the mid-1960s the Jonesville, Louisiana native found himself racing up the Billboard charts, appearing on Dick Clark’s television shows, and performing all over the US and UK on package tours with everyone from Otis Redding to The Yardbirds.
As a songwriter, Tommy's first successes came from penning #1 hit singles for Freddy Fender on Huey Meaux's legendary Krazy Kajun label out of Houston, Tx.
In 2018, Tommy shared with his protege and producer C.C. Adcock, a new batch of original songs that he has (quietly) crafted over the last several years. Remarkably, they are the most powerful and deeply moving of his repertoire to date.
At 78 years of age, Tommy McLain is possibly the last great artist from the pioneer rock n' roll generation left to be rediscovered. His many talents and stage charisma remain completely intact and untarnished after a lifetime spent on bandstands back along the bayous of his home. His story unlocks the history of swamp pop and is a mainline into what is unique about Louisiana music.

1741,Trae Tha Truth,"There are three ways to write about Trae tha Truth. One is to talk about his music, and that’s important because he is a rapper and making music is what he does. The other is to talk about him as a human, and that’s important, because he has done some truly monumental and impressive things. The third is to talk about the intersection of him as a rapper and him as a humanitarian, because that’s where Trae really belongs. Only a handful of people have ever blurred the borders of what it means to be a musician, and what it means to be a civic leader and then able to blend them together as well as Trae has.
Trae’s music is easy to categorize but difficult to fully translate into text. Trae is, for lack of a better term, a “street rapper.” His music is often inspired by the experiences of the disenfranchised, which is rooted in the broken roads of the ghetto. It’s driven by loss, by love, by loyalty, and by when one or two or all of those things are taken away or tested of those he cares about. 
Trae’s music is powerful, real, and his voice is a tractor trailer shoveling gravel and sometimes, it all adds up to be this scary thing. It booms and it bangs and it thumps. Sometimes it poun

Blending frequencies can have harmonic and discordant effects depending on how applied. The basis of my musical theory is to challenge listeners and delight attentive ears.

The 31 year old went to school in Durban where he lived for years even after school before settling in Johannesburg where he is currently based. 
Coming from a musical family, it was only when he met Kyle Deutsch while auditioning for Idols in 2013 that inspired him to make music incorporating influences as wide-ranging as Afrotraction, Musiq Soulchild, Nana Coyote, Usher, Anderson Paak, HHP and Boys II Men. Tribal only made it to the top50 of Idols that year, but he kept contact with Kyle whom he later helped produce some of his biggest records.

Formed in El Paso, Tribes breathed life back into the border city’s music scene with a Latin, dance-ready, live show loaded with meticulously arranged & crafted songs. The band’s sound meshes heavy drums with traditional mariachi instruments, adding rich melody-harmony and focusing on songwriting that pulls from traditional mariachi. It is invigorating & fresh, combining progressive & traditional mariachi with English & Spanish lyrics - a showcase of the band's culture & spirit. “It brings a new and exciting style, unexplored in many ways by combining what we know & love with music of our roots,"" says band member Mike Hernandez. 
With plans to release two 7-inch singles and a full-length album later this year, Tribes is looking forward to spreading their sound to new audiences in Texas and beyond.

A name that reflects a lack of artifice in the music and the vision of the people behind it: Phoebe Lou and Joey Clough, kindred musical spirits who have been doing this since they were 15. With support already from from the likes of Gorilla vs Bear, XLR8R and Stereogum, their appearances at SxSW will be their first in the US. Like all good projects, this one started with a manifesto. “Let’s aim small and let it be big,” the pair wrote in a lengthy document guiding the recording process of debut album First Body, out via Liberation Records (Vance Joy, Julia Jacklin) and Terrible Records (Solange, Blood Orange) January 2019. Phoebe and Joey weren’t exactly sure what kind of music would come out of those early sessions in 2015, but they were clear on how they wanted to do things. Their art would be sustainable, long-term, and almost entirely self-made. It’d be guided by bold visual cues, DIY principles, and artists that emphasise the empty space between notes as much as the notes themselves; artists such as James Blake, Caribou, and Jamie xx. “The music, above all else has to move you, physically and emotionally,” they wrote. And it does.

A well-established and acclaimed guitar player and singer in the burgeoning western North Carolina music scene, where he calls home, he first learned to play music on piano before moving to the guitar. Ramsey grew up listening to and studying country-blues guitar players like Mance Lipscomb and Mississippi John Hurt, and American finger pickers like John Fahey and Leo Kottke, absorbing their sound and making it all his own.

The story of Ume begins with Lauren falling in love with not turning down as a 15 yr old guitarist in a noise punk band. Dedicated to performing like her life depended on it, Lauren’s music career took her from DIY shows, to Ume playing major festivals like ACL and Paris' Rock En Seine and appearing on Anthony Bourdain’s No Reservations. 
After taking a break to start a family, Lauren and bassist Eric Larson teamed with powerhouse drummer Aaron Perez and Grammy-winning engineer Stuart Sikes (Loretta Lynn, Cat Power) to reawaken the band. The acclaimed and triumphant result 'Other Nature' was released on Modern Outsider in 2018.

1779,Vab,"VAB is an up and coming rap artist. Versatile, Authentic, and Bold, describes his musical style which consists of dynamic rhythms and melodies. VAB’s influences include many southern artists such as James Prince, Percy Miller, Scarface, and Andre 3000. In 2016 VAB created From Poverty to Paradise Records (FPP), his own independent label.   
Born and raised in West Monroe, LA as Philip Outley, he has always had a strong passion for music and the way it allows him to express himself. About 10 years ago, his passion led him to join a local rap group with friends where he gained additional experience writing, producing and recording. 
Due to his desire for personal growth as an artist, he decided to pursue a rap career as a solo artist, VAB. He has collaborated with a variety of local artists, opened for deserving acts, and has also participated in interviews by multiple radio personalities. 
VAB is currently working on his 4th mixtape release as well as continuing to write and produce music for other artists.

1780,Vacationer,"The third full-length from Vacationer, Mindset is built on delicate melodies and crystalline rhythms that seem to alter the very texture of the world around you. Ornately composed but breezy in energy, Vacationer’s warm-hearted dream-pop perfectly mirrors frontman Ken Vasoli’s intentions in making the album. “The objective was to write songs that remind me how my brain needs to operate for my own wellbeing and happiness,” Vasoli says. “That’s where the title comes from—the record’s filled with all these reminders that put me in a good mindset for the day.”
Despite its often-euphoric effect, Mindset began in frustration for Vasoli. After countless false starts on the follow-up to 2014’s Relief, the Philadelphia-based musician decided to completely upend his creative approach. While Vacationer’s previous albums came to life in close collaboration with fellow members Matthew Young and Grant Wheeler, Vasoli shifted his focus from songwriting to production and worked entirely on his own for months on end. During that time, he immersed himself in exploring the nuances of Ableton and analyzing the construction of beloved albums by artists like the Beach Boys, Barry White, and Curtis Mayf

They’ve been steadily building up a fanbase worldwide completely on their own terms and through the internet with a unique blend of indie rock, jazz, and shoe-gaze.  
VACATIONS released their debut album ‘Changes’ last year in March. A bittersweet and nostalgic mix of arrangements, ‘Changes’ is multi-layered and rich work recorded almost entirely from home, before the neighbours complained and they had to shift the last of recording to a nearby studio. ‘Changes’ separates them from their contemporaries and highlights their development on all fronts from earlier releases like Vibes and Days.
VACATIONS show no signs of slowing down anytime soon. With more touring worldwide and new material on the horizon, it’s early days in this band’s career.

This is trap music for the connoisseur, for fans of clever lyrics and effortless style. Valee grew up on Chicago's South Side. When he received toys as a child, he would break them apart to figure out how they worked, a method he applies to his own process with music today: ""Sometimes I rap and cut and copy and paste and move parts around and it changes the whole song, for the better."" His music career began when, intent on buying a gaming system, he stopped at Guitar Center instead. ""I just wanted to make beats better than what I hear on my mixtapes or on the radio, and I wanted to rap on it. I wasn't thinking about anyone else at all.""

1783,Valley Maker,"Valley Maker is the songwriting project of South Carolina-bred, Seattle-based musician and PhD student in Human Geography, Austin Crane. His new album, Rhododendron, was released October 12 on Frenchkiss Records. This new record reflects both the rootedness and rootlessness that shapes Crane's songwriting on the precipice of his third decade. Named for the common plant which springs up in both Crane’s native south and his current home in Washington, Rhododendron is an album about transition, about leaving, but also arriving, a document of the journeys in-between. 
The album was recorded between two locales. In Portland, OR, Crane teamed with producer Chaz Bear of Toro y Moi. Longtime friends and schoolmates from the University of South Carolina, Bear and Crane laid the groundwork for the record, playing all instruments in tracking four songs between themselves. The rest of the record was tracked in Seattle with producer Trevor Spencer (Father John Misty, Fleet Foxes), enlisting drummer James Barone (Beach House, Tennis) and bassist Eli Thomson (Father John Misty) and longtime collaborator Amy Fitchette to round out Rhododendron's lush but spacious sound.

Fiercely proud of their homeland, Vandoliers put their own spin on the Texas country tradition with 2016's Ameri-Kinda, a debut album that mixed honky-tonk twang with hard-edged, rock & roll stomp. The band's follow-up release, The Native, arrives less than one year, doubling down on Vandoliers' modern approach to traditional influences. Rounded out by bassist Mark Moncrieff, drummer Guyton Sanders, fiddler Travis Curry, electric guitarist Dustin Fleming, and multi-instrumentalist Cory Graves, the group fills The Native's 10 songs with barreling guitar solos, train beats, anthemic melodies, mariachi horns, and the autobiographical details of Fleming's own travels.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.",Alt Country,Americana,"Dallas, TX",http://audio.sxsw.com/2019/mp3_by_artist_id/731db970717a33d1a3a36273d6d7b3e718b32d23390300a8424e31cbf28af02d.mp3,Vandoliers at Continental Club,"Mar 13, 2019",9:00pm-9:40pm,Continental Club

With a sound reminiscent of Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers mixed with the grit and twang of the Allman Brothers Band, The Vegabonds deliver a sensational performance, with powerhouse guitar riffs and impactful songwriting, night after night. From Ole Miss to South Carolina, students were buzzing about The Vegabonds’ authentic sound and their seemingly effortless ability to bring the house down. The group’s fan base rapidly grew and the guys learned there was something distinctive to their eclectic mix of Southern Rock, Country, and earnest songwriting. They kick off 2019 with the release of their fifth album (and first for Blue Élan Records) ""V"". Produced by Tom Tapley (Blackberry Smoke, Mastodon) “V” audibly illustrates the band’s unconventional yet contagious brand of Southern rock and highlights the best of The Vegabonds’ unique musicianship, vocals, lyrics and sound.

The bass line ferociously drives the car and the drums make sure you stay on the road - this is one of those trips where you sporadically wake up and find yourself in strange situations, wondering how the f*ck you got there.
From the Shrimp shack to the dog show, one minute you’re playing rugby ball the next moment you’re being eaten by worms, and between the fading lights and the strange look on your friend’s face Murphy grabs your ears and asks you what it really is you want from this life.
This is an album about illusions of realness, the absurdum of existence and the joke on humanity.
‘Street Worms’ is Viagra Boys debut studio album, a debut that instantly let them occupy their absolute own space in music history.

If it ain’t raw it’s worthless rap.
And that’s Vince Ash. 
Visceral and potent, Vince hails from Hammond, Ind., and embodies all that is the Midwest. His world is bleak and sinister, sepia-tinted. Some Do or Die, straight out the mud rap. Or, as Andrew Barber from FakeShoreDrive puts it, “Vince is easily one of the hottest new talents repping Indiana — especially the Northern part of the state. [His style] is eerie and infectious— one that you won’t soon forget. This one has been embedded in my brain since I first heard it, if we’re being factual. [Vince Ash’s] music sticks to your bones. You can feel it in your soul.”
Vince released the critically acclaimed, Do or Die, via POW Recordings in 2018, and is currently recording it’s follow-up due later this year.

Fast forward years of touring, writing and recording with multiple bands, Holiday landed in the Jersey City art scene and started to release music under his own moniker. 
With a downtown NYC lo-fi sound, written and recorded at his studio in the heart of historic Greenwich Village, Holiday is working towards his upcoming, currently untitled debut album. NYLON declared his debut single Quit Playing Cool as “Uniquely self-aware and poignant.” A feeling that Holiday ironically fights against in his second track Children, which romanticizes the innocence of a less self-aware time. “Lie and say this world is fine / That we will be alright,” he sings in this melancholy, nostalgia driven track. Holiday’s latest “Like in the Movies” was featured on Spotify’s New Music Friday and New Indie Mix playlists.

1803,VOILÀ,"“Refreshing,” “Romantic,” and “Relatable” are a few of the terms used to describe L.A.- based pop/rock act VOILÀ. Gus Ross and Luke Eisner, respectively from London and Wisconsin - combine authentic production, emotive vocals and magnetic lyricism as a duo. 

Ross started out busking around London, which led to playing shows in London’s infamous West End: even performing for the Queen. He is fascinated by the technicality of music and handles production. On the other side of the world, Eisner’s passion for music came through lyricism: fascinated by timeless literature, he fronted bands in the midwest scene. Eisner, also maintains a professional modeling career, which helps craft the duo's aesthetic. Luke also is the lead in an upcoming Netflix original movie, ""Tall Girl,"" produced by McG and coming in Fall of 2019. 

VOILÀ started 2018 as one of BBC Introducing Solent’s “Ones to Watch.” After success on Spotify and BBC radio, the band drew eminent praise from the likes of Billboard, Pandora, Ones to Watch, and more. Their most recent single ""Don't"" debuted at #19 on Spotify's New Music Friday. In 2018 alone, they have supported Kesha, The Fray, and X Ambassadors.

1804,Volition Immanent,"At the crossroads where man meets machine stands Volition Immanent, a two-man band intent on delivering highly personal live performances that shock, inspire and amaze in equal measure.
Since first joining forces in 2014, hardware freak Parrish Smith and former punk activist Mark van de Maat (founder of Amsterdam’s admirable Knekelhuis label) have earned a reputation for delivering the kind of incendiary live shows that were once the preserve of British multi-media mavericks such as Cabaret Voltaire and Throbbing Gristle.
With Smith working a range of hardware gear – three drum machines, two samplers, outboard effects units and a range of vintage synths – and van de Maat adding forthright vocals, the duo has struck up a rapport with live audiences across Europe and beyond. Mutilating and manipulating their songs on the fly, Volition Immanent takes no prisoners in pursuit of artistic expression.
March 2019 they release their 2nd EP on MIND Records, after their last years album and 7""EP. This will put Volition Immanent’s instinctive, do-it-yourself approach to music-making and performance centre stage, offering an insight into their intoxicating brand of no-holds-barred intensity.

1806,WAAX,"Australia’s most electrifying punk band, Waax, emerged from Brisbane in 2015, possessing an intensity and captivating, barely-controlled chaos that had been missing from the local music scene for years. Early singles, ‘I For An Eye’ and ‘Wisdom Teeth,’ were fresh and fiercely ambitious, with vocalist Maz De Vita’s unbridled passion and seductively melodic flow full of hooks. 2017’s Wild & Weak EP saw their popularity grow exponentially off the back of tracks like ‘Same Same’ and ‘This Everything,’ as did their striking reputation as a live band. Radio soon stepped up to the plate and carried these honest and hard-nosed new tunes across the globe. Now we land at the next phase of their career and the immense new single ‘Labrador.’ It doesn’t take long listening to realise that once again you’re in brand-new Waax territory in ‘Labrador’ – undeniably the biggest song of their career. Above all else, the focus continues to be drawn to De Vita’s concentrated vocals, sounding smoother and more emotionally raw than ever. “I want to be the voice that I couldn’t hear when I was young,” says De Vita. With songs like ‘Labrador’ in her arsenal, she’s well on her way to achieving that goal.

1807,Waco Brothers,"The Waco Brothers have been standing at the corner of punk urgency and Three-Chords-And-The-Truth country for 20 years now. They started at a time when it was deemed patently absurd to mix the two types of music, but the Wacos knew the score; they are different sides of the same coin, the personal wrapped in the political. And instead of travelling calculated creative boulevards during their career, the Waco Brothers have explored dark alleys and winding gravel paths through nine releases, all with the headlights off and the pedal to the metal, worrying (or not worrying) about end results later. With a body of work known for the indelicate and raucous, this may be their most deliberate and punchy yet—no one’s more dangerous than a man with nothing to lose. The title can be read two different ways, after all.

She had an intercontinental upbringing before beginning to write songs as a break from pre-med studies at university. Today, WAFIA makes brooding pop music with a soulful delivery. Her solo EP “VIII” saw release in 2017 prominently written with long-term collaborator Ben Abraham, who's also worked with artists ranging from Demi Lovato to Kesha and Gallant. Wafia then made waves lending her angelic vocals to Louis the Child’s smash summer jam “Better Not”; The song has accumulated over 67 millions of streams on Spotify, peaking at #8 on the US Viral Chart. Wafia joined the Interscope Records duo to perform the song during their sets at Coachella and the stunning Red Rocks Amphitheatre. During all the buzz, Wafia retreated to a studio in Los Angeles to begin quietly working on new music. In August of 2018, she unveiled the first creation from that process, an upbeat track entitled “I’m Good.” The song was co-written by Wrabel (Ellie Goulding, Adam Lambert), produced by Rogét Chahayed (Travis Scott, Solange) and Grammy-nominated writer/ producer John Hill (Portugal.

Through their music, they attempt to reconcile their Arab roots with their North American lives, infusing Middle-eastern sounds into songs that are inspired by Detroit techno and 80-90s pop/rock.
Wake Island is currently cementing its place in their local Arab and queer scenes. Their upcoming full length offers songs in three languages (English, French and Arabic) that testify to a truly personal perspective on modern life in Western societies.

1810,Walker Lukens,"""For better or worse, I tried to make a record about how absurd it has felt to be alive over the past few years, that sounds like how its feels to build a life while the world you were promised changes,"" says Walker Lukens, describing the broad premise behind his new album 'ADULT,' out April 26 via Modern Outsider Records. ""I also wanted to make a record that made people dance...so, here ya go.""
Now on his third full-length release, the Austin, TX-based songwriter has become well known for embracing contradiction, ""blending genres and techniques"" (Billboard) into a sound that's hard to pin down. NPR's All Songs Considered described him as a ""rhythmic sound effect master"" who creates ""curious, textured music,"" while World Cafe called it ""wonderfully inventive.""
""I’ve never wanted to be one of those songwriters who compartmentalizes what part of their lives comes out in their songs,"" he says. ""I wanted to deal with Trump, and Charlottesville, and the 'Me Too' movement alongside things like breaking up and falling in love.""
Lukens took creative inspiration from work like Bob Dylan's famously wide-ranging double LP 'Blonde on Blonde' as well as Frank Ocean's 'Blonde'.

1813,Wand,"By now, Wand is the shifting but unmistakable collaboration between Californian scrap polymorphs Sofia Arreguin, Cory Hanson, Robert Cody, Lee Landey and Evan Burrows. Their new album, Laughing Matter, is marked by the confidence and exuberance of a band that has lived, feuded, thrived and grown together through years of dedicated jamming, touring and recording. In this hyper-individualistic world, Wand listen to each other, and this is the sound. 
Largely recorded on the infamous southern border of broken, decadent America, Laughing Matter belongs to the after-life. After the dull flood. As rock n roll lurched sideways and fell away, drunkenly lost in a funhouse mirror of…recycled Funhouses. With no major label funding, no management or lawyers, no corporate distribution, and near zero social media presence, Wand have toured the world a bajillion times in five years and made four varied and compelling records, accumulating a devoted following. There may be a future in rock music beyond slapping rote regurgitations onto a lifeless syntactic grid. With devotion and time, the seeds you plant with intention and care grow back into the world.

1814,The Wants,"The Wants offer a union of downtown New York punk with minimal techno marked by songwriter Madison Velding-VanDam's earnest yet absurdist observations. The group flexes their obsessiveness to earn the tagline ""Brooklyn's Most Anxious Dance Party"" using skeletal components that interlock seamlessly, a guise of their complexity. 
A multimedia project at heart, The Wants see their music as a component of a wider artistic universe designed to communicate their perspective. Velding-VanDam's attention to detail extends to the graphic and product design, marketing materials, and the filming and editing of their video content. He found a wealth of inspiration in ""Pleasures and Terrors of Domestic Comfort"" a 1991 retrospective of American photography.
Each member is highly active in the Brooklyn scene: Lydia Gammill is the egoslob ""Gustaf""; Jason Gates drums for veterans ""Veda Rays""; and Madison Velding-VanDam is the guitarist and a composer for ""BODEGA"". Their machine like rhythm section features Gammill's syncopated bass lines locking firmly with Gates' metronomic precision. Between caustically humorous lyrics, Velding-VanDam's guitar thrashes like a deranged Pete Townshend.

1816,War Cloud,"Erupting in 2014, out of Oakland, California, War Cloud has been on a steady path of shredding Northern Californian ear drums. Founder Alex Wein (vocals, guitars), moved across the country to heed the immortal clarion call of the West Coast and wasted zero time in recruiting musicians after firmly planting his amps in the Bay Area. Looking to create an aural ash cloud of volcanic rock, Alex solidified this crew with Bay Area natives Joaquin Ridgell (drums), Jesse Serrano (guitar), and Taylor Roach (bass). 
War Cloud may be a young band but they are far from wide-eyed innocents. Their musical history drenched in molten riffs across the timeline of heavy metal, the name alone originates from a Wicked Lady song of the same title. With roots encompassing everything from the modern stoner rock scene by way of classic acts ranging from Led Zeppelin to Angel Witch this is a group who love to dig deep into the beating heart of the underground. War Cloud has created a new flavor of heavy rock music for those enjoying the devilish sounds served up by the likes of Saxon, UFO, Thin Lizzy, and Pentagram.
This is modern metal sophistication dipped deep in ‘70’s heavy fuzz rock.

 The two people in Warm Drag do specific things. Vashti Windish sings, the way Siouxsie sang power, the way Nico sang allure, the way Patti sang sex. Paul Quattrone makes the noise with two Akai MPC 1000 samplers. Beats that pummel or seduce, usually simultaneously, synths that soar like Morricone or pump like DAF, and gloriously twangy guitars that clang and echo like Duane Eddy spiraling down a k-hole.
 Lyrically, Warm Drag dive head-first into right now, careening from love to the end times, broken hearts to rotting bodies, devastation, lies and emotional self-defense. They have something to say, but they'd never be so gauche as to over-explain.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.",Rock,Post-Punk,"Los Angeles, CA",,Warm Drag at Hotel Vegas Patio,"Mar 15, 2019",10:00pm-10:30pm,Hotel Vegas Patio

1819,Warm Human,"Warm Human, the solo “sludge pop” project of Meredith Johnston, is a combination of feelings, alone time and sine waves. Bridging the gap between diary rock and synth pop, Warm Human uses fuzzy drones, ambient textures and pressurized 808's to accentuate the desperation of being a living breathing person. Her mixtape, Worm Human, is streamable on all things streaming, and her debut LP, Ghastly will be released early 2019.
“Her upcoming album, Ghastly, tells deeply personal stories through a melange of synths, vocal processing and brilliant pop arrangements. As a producer, composer and lyricist, Meredith infuses feeling into each bit of the albums DNA. She tells her side of the story with a balance of ferocity and compassion, that is at times both uniquely funny and absolutely heartbreaking. Ghastly will, no pun intended, haunt you well after it’s last track.” - Dan Derks, Sound + Process podcast

1823,Waylon Payne,"“I’m back from the grave,” Waylon Payne sings on his new album The Prodigal. For most, that sort of sentiment is hyperbole, but in Payne’s case, it’s an understatement. Produced by Frank Liddell and Eric Masse (Lee Ann Womack, Miranda Lambert), the record marks Payne’s first in 15 years, and it offers an unflinching account of his journey to the brink and back, chronicling addiction, heartbreak, and estrangement.
In the early 2000’s, he scored a major label deal for his debut solo album, ‘The Drifter.’ The record’s release should have been a triumphant moment for Payne, but instead it marked a drastic escalation of his decades-long freefall.
Hitting rock bottom and getting clean proved to be an excruciatingly difficult journey, but the result is a spellbinding story of redemption and reconciliation, an album that’s equally heartbreaking and uplifting as it celebrates the bittersweet beauty of survival.
The last few years of Payne’s life have been without a doubt the most productive—recent credits include co-writes with Miranda Lambert, Lee Ann Womack, and Ashley Monroe.
“There comes a time when a man’s got to stand on his own,” he concludes. “For me, that time has come.""

1825,Weakened Friends,"Common Blah is the debut full-length by Portland, Maine’s Weakened Friends. Founded by songwriter Sonia Sturino, bassist Annie Hoffman, and drummer Cam Jones in 2015, the trio is a low pressure outlet for emotionally volatile music. Engineered and produced by Hoffman and perfected over the last year, the record broadcasts heavy feelings amid screech and feedback with little more than a fuzz pedal to clog up the signal chain. 
For Sturino, writing in Weakened Friends is more of a physical process than a mental one. 
“I have to feel the vibration or sound coming out of my body. I need the physicality to do it, to enjoy singing it,” she says. “People probably hear the vocals and think, ‘she just puts on that weird voice,’ but it’s really just what comes out. It’s my body making that sound.”
Many of the songs reckon with deep mid-20s malaise — with the feeling of being young, stuck, and settling for less. “Sometimes, things look good on the outside, but they’re not working. That’s how it used to be for me. I’d hear, ‘You have a really cool job. You live in a cool city. Your band is cool.’ It was ‘Common Blah’ though because I was miserable. I didn’t care.

1828,Western Youth,"Five years in the making, Western Youth’s first full-length album has finally arrived. The band has done a lot of growing up since then, seeing its members through the life changes that accompany waxing youth - weddings, babies, careers, settling down, starting over. 
The self-titled album is colored by these changes, touching on unfulfilled dreams, honest and flawed relationships, an uncertain world - shot through with glimpses of light streaming in through the cracks. 
The result of all this is an evolved but still defiant Western Youth - introspective and poetic, but full of piss and vinegar, a unique sound that staggers artfully between rock n' roll, folk, americana, and something, well, more grown up.

1829,Wet Dreams,"Wet Dreams is a project with people from Death By Unga Bunga, FOAAAM and Warp Riders. The members found a collective interest for modern American psychedelic hard rock and punk, and has done a number of shows in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland after they started up in 2015. Most notably Øyafestivalen in Oslo. 
They released their debut ep, Cartridge Belt in 2017 that got attention far outside of Norway. 
Clash Magazine “Wet Dreams sent the needle into the red so long ago they've forgotten how to get it back. The band specialise in snarling garage punk with a proto-metal sneer, stomping on a never-ending row of Big Muff pedals in the process.”
NME “Imagine Motorhead covering The Hives. Add beer, punk, and stir. Doesn’t that sound fun?”
«77er Punk trifft Sixties Schmelz, herrlich! Für Freunde von Ty Segall, King Gizzard oder Jay Reatard uneingeschränkt zu empfehlen.» Intro.de
Songwriter Sebastian Ulstad Olsen has this to say about the music: «Even if the song structures aren’t miles away from the stuff I write in Death By Unga Bunga, I’ve been longing to challenge the recording and production process. I love music that bend the rules, so Wet Dreams is a great laboratory for this

1830,whenyoung,"Few bands can boast the kind of striking musical identity whenyoung have. Their story started in Limerick, Ireland. Singer/bassist Aoife Power, guitarist Niall Burns, and drummer Andrew Flood met for the first time as three teenagers after sneaking into Costello’s Tavern: the only bar in town that catered to their musical tastes. After bonding over cheap vodka and the sound of The Velvet Underground, they began playing music together and moved to London. 
The bands’ influences feed into a lineage that boasts everyone from The Cranberries to The Pogues. The band acknowledge those great literary songwriters perhaps no more so when they covered ‘Fairytale of New York’ last Christmas, which was immediately reciprocated when Pogues frontman Shane McGowan was singing their praises and invited them to play at his 60th Birthday party. 

Fusing that “immigrant song’” sensibility with their love of noise and melody, the group are transforming into a modern day answer to early Blondie or the Pixies. Huge shows alongside the likes of Nick Cave and Patti Smith came this summer. They’ve also supported the likes of Dream Wife, Declan McKenna, The Vaccines, Peace and Blossoms.

1831,White Denim,"Less than a year after their last album Performance, the ever-prolific White Denim are back with their eighth record Side Effects. More in line with the experimental, freewheeling spirit of their fan-favourite record Last Day of Summer than anything else they’ve done since, Side Effects is a record that captures the spirit of the band’s full-throttle live shows. Featuring a rotating cast of band members led by James Petralli and Steve Terebecki, these tracks draw on the sounds of different personnel to create a cohesive whole – the result being an album that’s as varied and vivacious as anything they’ve ever done.

1832,Whiteside,"Growing up in the late 80s and 90s Whiteside's love of music and poetry was sparked by listening to reords with his mother. After learning how to use ryming patterns from poetry he would eventually learn how to freestlye at school during any passing period, lunch, and even getting kicked out of class for rapping. His dream was always to entertain and unite people through his music. With his passion, lyricsicm, and raw emotion he's well on the way to achieving his dream and much more!
He was born in Midland, Tx in 1985. But shortly after Whiteside would move with his mother and become an official Ausinite in 1989. Always a great student he would finish his work early and start disrupting class either being a class clown or rapping. But being an only child raised by a single mother he would eventually become a victim of fast money, fashion, and the exotic women of the street life. Life started to make a turn for the better though after dropping back to back mixtapes with all frestyles. Then tragedy struck. 
Due to run-ins with law enforcement, becoming a father, and juggling life in the streets it would be years before Whiteside would get back to recording.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.Artist is seeking the following professional connections: PR/Publicity Agency",Hip-Hop / Rap,Hip-Hop / Rap,"Austin, TX",,Whiteside at Doris Miller Auditorium,"Mar 16, 2019",9:05pm-9:20pm,Doris Miller Auditorium

1834,Wierd Wolves,"Weird Wolves is an Austin, Texas based folk/goth fusion band formed in 2018. The band features singer/guitarist Ava Gore (vocals in the credit soundtrack for the award winning video-game Prey) and singer/guitarist/composer Raphael Colantonio, who has over 2 million YouTube views for his video-game songs (produced by Matt Piersal). Colantonio and Gore have continued their collaboration into beautiful and deep live experiences, where Ava's dark and distinctive voice connects powerfully with Raphael's emotionally grabbing melodies.

1835,Wieuca,"Wieuca is never minimalist. Since 2012, the group has been soaking twang, heavy beats and abstract sampling in heavy, textured layers of sound. Over their 14 releases (to date), the prolific foursome has plugged that aesthetic into styles ranging from alt-country to triphop to full-blown psychedelic freakout. The Baby Boys, as their followers call them, continue to expand their sound with frequent collaborations including tracks with Brooklyn rapper JAVAE, Georgia country artist Zach Wright, and many more.

1836,Wild Moccasins," Fronted by Zahira Gutierrez (vocals/keyboard) and Cody Swann (guitar/vocals), Wild Moccasins’ forthcoming third full-length serves as a new beginning for the group. Look Together tackles themes of repairing relationships, shedding insecurities, and fresh starts, with vibrant guitar/synth lines layered under Gutierrez’s pop melodies. The impassioned 12-track LP began to form merely a week after the release of 2014’s 88 92, as Gutierrez and Swann’s decade-long romantic relationship dissolved.
Healing proved to be difficult, as Wild Moccasins were charted for two years of extensive touring. Gutierrez and Swann would spend countless hours in a shared van, painfully staring each other down on stage and exchanging exaggerated he- said-she-said’s through songwriting.
Gutierrez and Swann began their writing partnership roughly a year into their romantic relationship, in 2007. The group has undergone roster changes over the years, but currently exists with the addition of Avery Davis (drums). Their latest effort is highly pop-powered, with Ben H. Allen (Gnarls Barkley, Deerhunter, Animal Collective) at the production helm.

1837,Wild Ponies,"Although they're based in Nashville, Wild Ponies have always looked to Southwest Virginia — where bandmates Doug and Telisha Williams were both born and raised — for inspiration. There, in mountain towns like Galax, old-time American music continues to thrive, supported by a community of fiddlers, flat-pickers, and fans.
 Wild Ponies pay tribute to that powerful music and rugged landscape with their most recent release Galax, a stripped-back album that nods to the band's history while still pushing forward. Doug and Telisha took some of their favorite musicians from Nashville (Fats Kaplin, Will Kimbrough, Neilson Hubbard and Audrey Spillman) and met up with revered Old-Time players from Galax, Virginia (Snake Smith, Kyle Dean Smith, and Kilby Spencer). Recorded in the shed behind Doug’s old family farm in the Appalachians (steps away from the site where Doug and Telisha were married), it returns Wild Ponies to their musical and geographic roots.

1838,Will Courtney,"After spending five years touring and recording two albums as the lead singer and songwriter of the Austin, TX band, Brothers And Sisters, Will Courtney decided to pack up and move back to Los Angeles...and then to Nashville...and then to a log cabin on some land in Dripping Springs, TX. Now, after two years of being based in Santa Fe, NM, where he produced albums for other artists and toured the US and Europe as a solo artist, he’s back in Austin with a new band and a new album, Crazy Love, on Super Secret Records.
When Will is not making music, he spends much of his time collecting 19th Century photographs and researching the history of the American West.  He recently worked on a new documentary series for the Discovery Channel about famous western outlaws called Gunslingers.  Will is a featured historian on Gunslingers: Billy The Kid.

1839,William Elliott Whitmore,"William Elliott Whitmore is a singer-songwriter/banjoist/guitarist/drum-stompin’ solo act from Lee County, Iowa. He has released six full-length albums that seamlessly meld country, blues, folk, and punk styles - spanning from 2003’s Hymns for the Hopeless (Southern Records) to 2015’s Radium Death (ANTI-). His songs are haunting, rustic, powerful, and real – byproducts of living his entire life on the family farm, being involved in the hardcore-punk scene in the local community, and touring hard across the country.

All the years between youth and now fly away into the air and the new songs being played promise an endless joy. William Harries Graham does that every night he sings his own songs, and as long as he does that the world will be a fine place to live. To hear him now is to hear it all."" 
Fresh off a 2018 summer European tour, William's new record JAKES drops in time for SXSW. JAKES is named after the neon sign in the back room of the legendary Continental Club in Austin, TX, where William and his band (featuring Abra Moore, Mike Meadows, David Goodrich, and Andrew Duplantis) play most Wednesdays nights. JAKES was recorded at Wire Studio by platinum engineer Stuart Sullivan. Germany's Blue Rose Records caught William Harries Graham with his band during SXSW 2016 soon releasing his 1st record, Foreign Fields, to Europe. Wired Magazine's listed William as one of “World’s Top Changing Innovator's: 50 People Who Will Change the World. William is finishing his university studies at the University of Texas, Austin in the prestigious Honors Plan II program.

1842,Willie J Healey,"Willie J Healey developed his skills via the old school method of acoustic shows and local support gigs. Being able to record at home only amplified his abilities, and a couple of EPs released on small indie labels attracted the attention of Columbia, who hoped he’d emerge as the next Ed Sheeran.
But as comparisons with everyone from Deerhunter, Kurt Vile and Mac DeMarco to Chris Isaak and Lou Reed emerged, it was clear that he was instead destined to be the one and only Willie J Healey. It was a great experience with some ups and downs, but his goal was more simple and remains unchanged – to be able to write songs that he likes and then share them with audiences. His latest EP set to be released by new music champions YALA! Records.
Everything is now in place for Willie J Healey to live up to his limitless potential. “I try not to be too aware of trends, so I can focus on writing the best song I can regardless of whether I think it will be cool or not.” He notes how the great albums of the ‘70s feel out of time in contrast to the booming drums and slick production that places many ‘80s records firmly within their era. “A timeless classic will never go out of fashion.”

Jones released his first single, “Runs In Our Blood” on all streaming platforms, as well as an official music video that premiered exclusively on TheBoot

the industry,” stated The Boot earlier this summer. Breaking into Country music, Jones has already
been featured on top Country music playlists from Amazon Music Unlimited, Apple Music, Spotify,
TIDAL and YouTube Music. Jones has toured on the MAGcon Tour featuring artists including Cameron

1844,Will Johnson,"Over the course of his quarter-century-plus career, Will Johnson has dealt with every challenge a musician can face. The silver lining, however, is that the Austin-based songwriter excels at taking bumps in the road and turning them into gold.
A week before Johnson was to begin tracking his fifth solo album, Hatteras Night, A Good Luck Charm, he hit one such bump: His usual studio haunt, the Echo Lab—where he’s recorded solo work, albums by his beloved former band Centro-matic and side projects such as South San Gabriel—suddenly became unavailable due to a fire. Luckily, a friend and collaborator, Britton Beisenherz (Monahans, Milton Mapes) stepped in and offered up his Austin, Texas, studio, Ramble Creek Recording.
The last-minute switch was a blessing in disguise. First, the session now brought together both old friends (his Centro-matic bandmate Matt Pence, a pal of 27 years and the Echo Lab’s manager) and newer friends (Beisenherz, Ricky Ray Jackson, who’s worked with Phosphorescent and Steve Earle).
In addition, this combination of musicians ended up unexpectedly adding more depth to the album’s desolate, folk- and Americana-leaning songs. Anxious soundscapes—specifically,

1845,Will Varley,"WILL VARLEY
Singer-songwriter Will Varley has come a long way since his early days haunting the open mics of South London and busking around on The Underground. After releasing his 5th studio album in 2018, his largely sold out UK tour drew to a close with a triumphant show at London's legendary Shepherd's Bush Empire.
There is a depth to Will's songwriting that sets him apart, and has propelled his music far and wide. From songs like 'The Man Who Fell To Earth' which tells the heart-wrenching story of an Angolan immigrant attempting to enter the UK, to the hyper-engaging 'Weddings and Wars' in which he attempts a history of the world in under four minutes, Varley's songs seem to transcend themselves, marrying vivid imagery, politics, emotion and surrealism to capture his musings in a way that is quite remarkable. 
Over the past few years Will has toured relentlessly across Europe and America as support act for Billy Bragg, Frank Turner, Valerie June and The Proclaimers and he's sold out his own headline shows in cities as far a field as Berlin, Zurich, Amsterdam and Vienna. High praise from the likes of Tim Minchin and Simon Nicol of Fairport Convention have helped fan the flam

1846,Wintersleep,"“The average Canadian carries around with them in their head a vision of spaciousness.” So theorized Canadian composer R. Murray Schafer, describing a so-called ‘Canadian sound.’ For Schafer and many others, it was a sound defined by space, by the land and our distance from and proximity to it. For Harry Freedman, it was “gaunt” and “lonely.” Elaine Keillor called it “immense, empty, mysterious, harsh, indifferent, producing a response of awe mingled with terror and an intense sense of spiritual loneliness.”
On Wintersleep’s seventh full-length record, In the Land Of, this geography is both real and imagined. It is understood that our surroundings are not, in fact, essential or concrete elements; they’re constructed in relation to us, the inhabitants. Our identities, too, are constructed in relation to the land. The land, both physical and figurative, changes, and so do we. Familiar land. Foreign land. Inhospitable land. Unceded land. Stolen land. Dead land.
This might be why In the Land Of doesn’t inhabit one terrain, but many. It might also be why none of these terrains feel comfortable. “I don’t really feel 100% at home anywhere,” says vocalist and guitarist Paul Murphy. “Over

""Wohl appeared from nowhere to release a mature, complex and beautiful album"" Picnic Magazine
The band communicates a rich palette of emotions without the need of a spoken narrative, using melodic expression, contrasting dynamics and sonic atmospheres to create a cathartic yet longing statement. 
Their debut album ''En Vida'' (In Life) was launched in 2017 at the The Art and Culture Forum in Guadalajara accompanied by a string quartet (arrangements written by the band itself). Since the release of their debut album in 2017 they have been performing in Mexico solidly. Wohl has been an opening act for international bands like LITE (Japan), Sleep Party People (Denmark), Yndi Halda (England), Delta Sleep (U.K), and Hikes (USA). 
Their new EP by Wohl is due the first half of 2019.
Additionally to SXSW, they are confirmed to showcase at Live at Heart in Sweden in September 2019.

They will be touring Australia, UK, Ireland, Germany and the US in support of the album and to collect and share new stories with local audiences. Wolf & Moon’s music lives of the dichotomy of their voices and marries dreamy indie folk with electronic elements.
The album was recorded when they packed their whole lives into one car and went off for a long Swedish Summer. In Stockholm they met multi-platinum Grammy nominee, John Andersson, who became an instant friend and the producer of the album. Lyrically they take you on a journey through your favourite travel memories. Musically they will make you dream away and personally, they will make you feel like you've been friends for a long time.

1849,Wood & Wire,"With their latest GRAMMY nominated record “North of Despair”, it’s the melding of hard country songwriting with high-octane bluegrass instrumentation that makes for Austin, TX based Wood & Wire’s signature sound. Tony Kamel, Trevor Smith, Dominic Fisher, & Billy Bright cut these tunes live to tape with minimal editing bringing the well known ferocity of their live shows, and an impromptu joy to each track - a joy that developed out of playing over 150 shows a year since 2014.

1852,Worn-Tin,"‘Lo-fi lullaby maker Worn-Tin is just a boy who grew up skating in West LA with his imaginary friend Cool-son,’ as described by Citizine. Worn-Tin, AKA Warner (a friend drunkenly called him “Worn-Tin”) began writing and playing original music during his high school days in Santa Monica, California. He eventually built a backyard studio where he writes, records, and performs every element of his songs using only analog and outboard equipment, taking inspiration from a multitude of artists such as Modest Mouse, R. Stevie Moore and Jessie’s Candy and The Fit Bit.
 
Much like Worn-tin’s hyperactive mind, his sounds and lyrics are sprawling: his vocals range from the type of cadence and vulnerability that would make Dongo the ringworm smile, to distorted, psychedelic whaling and synths. 
 
That same lucid unpredictability has become the staple for his live shows. At a Worn-Tin show, it’s not only about the music - you can expect a performance. from drinking his own urine to getting arrested on stage.
 
When not feverishly writing new music, Worn-Tin can be found skating, gardening or crying in the attic.

Introduced to 50 Cent, Eminem, Kanye West, Jay-Z, Nas, Lupe Fiasco, and T.I. by her older brother, Wynne immediately took to the art form.

After releasing a 7"" (""The Silence/The Knife"" aka ""the Rat Trap 7"""") and LP (The Redeemer) less than a year after forming, drummer Matt Buie relocated to DC, so they enlisted Houston newcomer Jay Dilick (Super Thief, Uncle Jesus) to join up. 2017 sophomore effort ""The Tower"" shows the band solidifying their sound and was well-received, building anticipation to their 3rd LP due 2019 on Matador dude Gerard Cosloy's personal label, 12XU. Having spent most of 2017 and 2018 touring (and documenting - XETAS made and released a tour documentary using only their cell phones and free software) it's obvious this band works hard and knows what they're about. A successful run of dates with Superchunk, Speedy Ortiz, and Proud Parents in 2018, and rumors of touring with Built to Spill in 2019, I highly recommend you mess with XETAS.

""Most of the South Korean music that reaches the West has been determinedly poppy, perfectly groomed and eager to please. The hip-hop duo XXX has other, far more confrontational plans"" - The New York Times
""XXX take cues from their own culture and mash them up with weirder found sounds, proving that Korean rap can innovate, not just replicate"" - Pitchfork
South Korea's groundbreaking producer/rapper duo XXX recently released 'Second Language', the direct follow-up album to their innovative debut Language, and the second half of the duo's two-disk double album. The new album builds on the statement of sonic dissonance from mainstream Korean music that bilingual rapper Kim Ximya and producer FRNK made with their debut. The duo channel their anger and discontent with the preconceived formula of Korean pop hits into dense new layers of hip hop and instrumentation. With their new album, XXX aims to push the envelope even further as the torchbearers for this new direction of Korean hip-hop.

1872,Y La Bamba,"Bio: Y La Bamba has been many things, but at the heart of it is singer-songwriter Luz Elena Mendoza’s inquisitive sense of self. Their fifth record, Mujeres, carries on the Portland-based band’s affinity for spiritual contemplation, but goes a step further in telling a story with a full emotional spectrum. Coming off Ojos Del Sol, one of NPR’s Top 50 Albums of 2016, Mujeres exhibits the scope of Mendoza’s artistic voice like never before. “Soy como soy,” Mendoza says, and that declaration is the bold— even political— statement that positions Mujeres to be Y La Bamba’s most unbridled offering yet.
The record exists in the post-2016 landscape of a national identity crisis, and Mendoza explores what it means to be a Mexican American woman by leading us through places we are afraid to go. Mujeresventures in to the discomfort of the stories we tell ourselves. Those of our past, our futures. We all have these stories somewhere inside of us, but with Y La Bamba, Mendoza forges new narratives from old stories of heritage and family, tracing history while forging modern chicana feminism.

Having recently signed with Interscope Records, Yoshi’s debut recording with the label, a mixtape entitled AMERICAN RAVER, was released on October 12th. The mixtape is a collection of songs that he wrote as a way to cope with the crazy happenings in America and in the world right now, stuck at the crossroads between radicalism and utter apathy.

namely singer, producer, rapper, dancer, actress, and “dope ass chick,” she laughs. However,
with her colorful aesthetic musically and stylistically, she lives up to all of the above—especially,
“dope ass chick.”
Music seemed predestined. Tate actually attended the 1996 GRAMMY® Awards in the
womb of her mother Dionne Farris of iconic rap group Arrested Development. As a kid in
Decatur, GA, she developed a passion for nineties R&B and hip-hop, citing Brandy, SWV, Missy and more as influences in addition to pop muse Gwen Stefani.
Sharpening a style of her own, the budding songstress made her introduction with 2015’s EP
ROYGBIV, and several singles leading up to the 2018 breakout BOYS EP. The latter produced a viral hit in the form of fan favorite “Bob,” clocking nearly a half-million cumulative streams within six months. Widespread
acclaim followed from The Fader, Creative Loafing, Mass Appeal, The Source, & more.
In the end, this rainbow is about to shine brighter than ever in 2018 and beyond.

This is evident in their intense performances which feature two guitars, a vast array of effect pedals, drum machines and synth modules, which are put to use as the pair weave together existing tracks with improvisational elements, to create both ear-piercing, dark noise as well as beautiful, droned-out soundscapes.
ZRN premiered their current set up as a duo at Copenhagen Psych Fest 2016, and have since had a busy live calendar in and outside of Denmark - including support for Bell Witch, Ulan Bator, Esben & the Witch - among others.
The duo has been featured twice on Drowned in Sound's ""Some Velvet Mixtape"" and Performed at WNIM'17.
